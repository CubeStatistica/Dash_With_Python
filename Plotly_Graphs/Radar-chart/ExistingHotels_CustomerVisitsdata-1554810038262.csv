hotel_101,hotel_2225,"Just An Average stay This was just an average stay, with nothing standing out. If the weather is good, I would recommend eating at the 13 Coins Restaurant which is a short walk from the Marriott, versus eating at the hotel restaurant. There is also a 7 Eleven about a block away if one needs other things. This is a typical Marriott, where they charge you for everything, including the Internet. What bothered me most was when I had to leave at 4:30am, and was waiting for my ride in the lobby, there was no staff around, and anyone could have walked into the place. It's not a bad place, but nothing stands out as being above average either.",13-Dec-08,0,0,4,4,1,4,4,4,3,3.5,$245

hotel_101,hotel_8440,"I Won't Go Back I stayed at the hotel 11/14/08 for 2 nights. I booked the package through Marriotts web site. The package incuded a deluxe room, free parking and a gas card. When we checked in we were told our room was not ready but they could give a handicapped room. I asked to look at the room. It was on the first floor facing the street and parking lot. I went back and said we would wait for our room. We came back 2 hours later and they gave me keys to room 199 which was 3 rooms away from the room we originally looked at, again facing the street and parking lot. I went back to the front desk and said I booked a deluxe room which was supposed to overlook the pool and be on a higher floor. I was told deluxe and standard rooms are the same. I was getting nowhere with the front desk. I went back to my 1st floor room and called the phone number on my marriott rewards card and explained the problem to them. I was told they would have a manager call me in my room. After no call I went to the managers office and talked to one of the managers and she said to me you want a deluxe room for the price you paid? I said yes that is what the package offers and I did not create the package I just bought Marriotts package. She then told me the package did not offer a deluxe room but a standard room. I told her that supposedly they are the same from what the front desk tells me. I told her that I had called the hotel directly before i booked and asked about the rooms and was told a deluxe room was a higher floor facing the pool. I then showed her my reservation confirmation which said deluxe room on it. The manager said well nobody else has complained. I told the manager that I could have stayed at the Hilton or Doubletree down the street cheaper and I will check out unless I get the room I paid for. Finally she says well your right I will get another room. I did get another room still on the first floor but facing the pool. The hotel was not very busy and we should have gotten the room we paid for which we never did. Bait and Switch at its best. I will stay at the Hilton or Doubletree down the street on my future visits to Seattle area. The room was okay very dark, small bathroom. The bed very comfortable. Old T.V. no flat screens.",18-Nov-08,0,0,2,4,3,4,2,3,1,3.5,$245 
hotel_101,hotel_4592,Good weekend stay My wife and I stay here quite regularly when we visit Seattle to see a football game. The shuttle from the airport is always on time and operates almost 24 hours a day. The rooms are typical Marriott and always clean and functional. The restaurant is good with some very good items and others quite normal. If there is a large convention in the hotel (which occurs quite regularly on weekends) be careful where your room is(stay away from pool side). The hotel is old but has been remodeled very recently but the noise in the hallways and especially around the pool can be very annoying. Standard complaint is the charge for internet usage.,19-Oct-08,0,0,5,5,6,6,5,5,3,3.5,$245 
hotel_101,hotel_5901,"Great airport stay Lovely indoor pool area, looks like a lodge. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean, very comfortable and spacious, with minimal noise from outside (you could hear planes, but only if you really listened for them). The breakfast buffet was good value with great coffee (Starbucks), but the omelet chef did not have the slightest clue as to what he was doing. I got more of a scramble than an omelet, and he might have put all of three spinach leaves in the whole thing, which cooked down to nothing. I booked a cars eat free package which included parking and a $25 gas card - if they still have this deal it is worth it. Overall a very good experience.",13-Oct-08,0,0,5,6,6,6,6,1,6,3.5,$245

hotel_101,hotel_3619,"No Free Internet? Wow, that irritates me! This hotel is amazing. I love the rooms, I love the fitness center, and I really love the pool area. It is a huge pool with two hot tubs that are actually, hot. I know this sounds odd but the hotel smells amazing. The staff was helpful and there are some restaurants in the area. One gripe, and it's a big one. The Internet. Will you please explain to me why the more expensive hotel chains charge for wireless but motels like Comfort Inn, and La Quinta, give complimentary internet? It is the number one complaint that I have against the whole Marriott chain. Although I do realize that some of the Marriott brands (Fairfield, Courtyard) offer the complimentary internet, I just believe that for $150 a night you should receive free internet!

hotel_101,hotel_8210,"good business hotel stayed here one night on business.I selected this hotel simply because the workshop that I was attending was held there. Seemed expensive, at ~$250/night, so I'd shop around if I were returning to the area. The hotel is about one mile from the airport, so very convenient in that regard. A complimentary shuttle runs every 15 minutes, and this is also a plus. My room (and based on what I saw, the other standard rooms) was not very big, but was well-appointed: luxurious king bed, chest of drawers, armchair with footstool, desk with work chair, Starbucks in-room coffee. The bathroom and amenities were nice. The room was clean and reasonably quiet. I did not bring my laptop, so can't comment on the internet connection, however, there is a business center with 2 computer stations where travelers can check email, etc, no charge. There is also a kiosk especially for doing airline web check-in so you can print your boarding pass, a nice touch. The hotel has an atrium, where the pool and jacuzzis are located. It is quite nice, with trees. The fitness room was better than I encounter at most hotels. They had a selection of cardio equipment: bikes, treadmills, elliptical trainers, plus some weight machines and free weights. There is a somewhat pricey cafe in the hotel. I had breakfast and lunch there. The food and service were good. There does not seem to be any other place to eat within walking distance. The staff were nice and courteous. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to a business traveler.",19-Aug-08,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$245

I do agree that the halls/elevator set-up is a little tricky, but asides from that small detail, I had a pleasant stay. I ate one meal in the main restaurant as well and it was quite good.

Was also given a discounted rate since we would be departing in a few hours. The rooms were very nice, wonderful beds, nice bathrooms. Service and food choices in the hotel restaurant were excellent.

hotel_101,hotel_6939,"Good hotel, charges for internet access The Marriott Airport Seattle is a reasonable choice in the Sea-Tac area. I paid about $189 per night. The shuttle is generally quick to and from the airport and I encourage its use rather taxi service which can be very spotty in Seattle. My room was in the second floor but in the back of the hotel such that I had a very long walk no matter which way I took to the room. The interior is nice and check in was very quick.Breakfast was good in the restaurant, if not a bit pricey. Drink service in the bar was fine, no complaints. I can imagine that it must get very noisy in the lobby when the crowd is hanging out in thebar. I guess Marriott has a new program where guests are now charged for internet service. Its $9.95 at this hotel, but can be had for free at the business center near the check-in counters. There are two internet PCs and one boarding pass access PC.Personally, the ability to sit in my room and check my personal or work email is nice and I am not sure how many takers will pay extra for the access. And I am hoping not to get nickel and dimed for that.I can offer four stars as the overall quality was good.",30-Oct-07,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,3.5,$245 
hotel_101,hotel_3976,"Small but adequate rooms If you have an early morning flight to catch, this is a good choice as it is right at the airport. It has been recently renovated so the rooms are new and clean. The room service was fast and efficient and the food was good. The negatives were that our room was very small and the bathroom was the smallest I've encountered in many years. Hardly room to turn around and I'm a small person. However, the countertops were granite, which was nice. Also there is only one elevator, which seemed odd for a hotel of this size. You may self park or valet park, both for a fee. Would not recommend for an extended stay, but it is fine for a one visit.",12-Oct-07,0,0,4,4,6,5,6,4,1,3.5,$245 
hotel_101,hotel_2851,"Better than average, some noisy rooms I have stayed at this hotel a few times inthe last several months. The first stay was not the best, but the subsequent ones got better, and they have obviously taken some of the notes on the comment cards seriously.The hotel is located near SeaTac with a frequent shuttle. There is a tower, 8-9 floors high, and an atrium area that is about 3-4 floors high. Note, the tower rooms really have no view although some are advertised as having Mt. Rainier views. (Maybe before the trees grew!) Regardless of where you are, in the tower youwill be looking at the roof/ventilation or the roof/associate entrance. Avoid rooms ending in X16 and X18 as these are a bit noisy when the trucks show up. Odd numbered tower rooms will be a little noisy from the AC but frankly it wasn't as bad!The bathrooms are small, and double double rooms are a little crowded. King rooms seem bigger and have a chair and ottoman. All have been redone very recently but don't have the big flat screen TVs. The desk is pretty roomy and there is a cabinet and 2 small drawers...not the greatest storage.Rooms in the atrium area are noisier for some reason. Aside from the noise from the pool (and functions if there are any being held near the pool), it seems that the walls are thinner....last time, I actually thought someone left a cellphone in my room it was ringing so loudly.Food in the hotel is good-could be better. It is a bit pricy. The restaurant is due to be redone 1st quarter 2008. Desserts however, were tasty, and since I had some issues with my meals, they were free! Try the chocolate cake, it is VERY good! The lobby/bar are nice but the music is a lot too loud! One of the songs played has some sort of random spoken sounds...very disconcerting!Internet is part of the $9.95 wired for business package so if you don;t make calls, it's too expensive. I don't know when Marriott will get it through their brains...STOP CHARGING FOR INTERNET! There is a business center with 2 computers and an ethernet cable that you can use for free. Also, you can get free use of internet in the concierge lounge.There are only a couple other dining choices in walking distance (Dennys and 13 coins-which I think is also too expensive.) Other than that, and restaurants in other hotels, you need a car or a cab. Self parking is $16 per day, valet is $22-very high, but it's the norm for cities!Be careful in the shower...tubs can get slippery (I fell). I was able to get a rubber mat, but I also informed the GM and several other people of the situation, and that housekeeping needs to rinse carefully.The hotel is very clean. I even noticed a housekeeper vacuuming the rock wall outside of the restaurant. The staff was friendly, remembering me by name, and by my luggage-which seems to go someplace else when I come to Seattle!Seems that this is also a popular hotel with cruisers as there were a large number of folks heading off to Alaska on Vision of the Seas...maybe this is a Royal Caribbean pre-cruise hotel.Some people hate the pacific northwest design of the hotel-the lobby looks like a lodge. Frankly, I think it is appropriate for the area. There are plenty of places inthe area, but all in all this hotel is nice for flyers or anyone needing to be out inthe SeaTac area. It's about 30-45 minutes to downtown and you can hop on a bus at the airport (I also think there is a stop at the end of the hill) or drive. Also, tours can be arranged-many of which will pick up at airport area hotels.Give it a try!",31-Aug-07,6,6,1,5,5,5,6,5,4,3.5,$245 
hotel_101,hotel_7897,"Ordinary Although it is highly rated in these reviews, and you pay a premium price compared with other airport hotels, there is nothing special about this hotel other than its proximity to SEATAC. If you are thinking of staying here, pay attention to the Trip Advisor comments about the hideous views of HVAC equipment from the windows on one whole side of the hotel. Although my room was on the top floor of the building, the view looked like an industrial site, just because of all the equipment on the roof of a lower wing of the building. The room itself was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was functional. But during a rainstorm in the middle of the night, the ceiling leaked. The club lounge, for which I had paid extra, was about as modest as any I've ever seen. But it did have good food at breakfast. The best part of the hotel in my experience was its restaurant. The room itself was extremely ordinary, looking like a roadside restaurant on a freeway, but the food and the service were first-rate. Bottom line: I slept well here. But even though I collect Marriott points, I don't think I'd return to this hotel.",18-Jul-07,4,4,3,4,3,5,4,1,5,3.5,$245

Check in was faster than I have ever experienced and had a newly renovated room on the 7th floor overlooking the airport (the parking garage actually). Room was larger than I expected (two double beds) and had plenty of room for the porta crib. The bellmen were very helpful with bags and even set the crib up for us. My Son and I went swimming and a had a great time. The beds were super comfortable and we slept well (very quiet). The hotel was not busy (very slow) but I don't think that would change if it was busy.Check out was very efficient.

Evidently the rate we got for park, sleep and fly was for AAA members only. This was not an option or even mentioned on their web reservation form. The front desk quickly recognized this as their error and we were off to our super comfy room. We had a great dinner in the restaurant. Super efficient drop off on departure day and much quicker pick up then some other hotels we have used in the past. One tiny little thing on our way back was the guy who picked us up stopped to pick up his take out dinner before he dropped us back at the hotel. That was kind of weird!!

There is a free computer off the lobby for printing boarding passes. The Hilton is a block away so you can easily walk over for their restaurant.

We came down and had dinner in the bar, ordering from the dining room menu. We had very good food. I'll return to stay a night just for the horseradish crusted salmon. We faced the very pretty atrium and didn't hear noise until 9 am. The reception area downstairs is comfy and has a warm feeling. Not like the # 1 ranked hotel I stayed in over Christmas. That was a cold uninviting space. I don't know if the one elevator to the 3rd floor and above would be a problem when the hotel is crowded. Maybe I missed another elevator. All in all, we had a wonderful. comfortable relaxing stay and I'll go back. The rooms are just as nice as the Marriott Waterfront as far as comfort goes.

It was only a 10 minute trip from the airport to the Courtyard. Check-in was fast. Only problem was I thought we could get a free shuttle to the cruise ship but it was too far. But the desk staff did arrange a Town Car service to pick us up next morning. We were guaranteed a non-smoking room and got one. No smell of smoke at all. Room was large with 2 queen beds with down quilts, an overstuffed chair, desk and chair, vanity mirror and bureau with t.v. on it. Very clean. Bathroom was 2-part with toilet and tub/shower in one large room, with the sink and mirror in a separate area outside. Made it convenient. Dinner at Charley's restaurant in the hotel was good and reasonably priced--Western burger with fries and Patty Melt with fries each under $8.95. Breakfast buffet was good too with bread, bagels, omelet bar, fruit, hot and cold cereal, yogurt. We were very pleased with the hotel--especially the cleanliness--and would definitely stay here again.",17-Jul-06,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$245

hotel_102,hotel_1790,Great place I have stayed at the Del Sol many times and think its a steal as far as the price and the location go. The marina district in san francisco is probably the best locale in the city however there are only motels on lombard that are seedy you would never stay there. Along comes the del sol. it has a monopoly on travelers who want to stay in the marina at a safe nice hotel with no add ons and no frills. the continental breakfast is excellent too.,18-Oct-08,0,0,5,6,6,6,6,6,2,4,$192

We had room 326 which had a room for the kids, and our room with small kitchen area and bathroom. Really clean and comfortable, very bright and cheery. The breakfast was basic but did the job. Missed a normal cup of tea though. Pool was good for the kids after a day sightseeing. Hotel was in a great area and we walked to Fisherman's Wharf one day. Only negative was hearing noise during the night from both the street and other rooms but I believe they are trying to recify that.

We Have been there before 3 years ago and as it was before, it was a nice experience.We booked the FAMILY SUITE, it comes with 1 queen bed in one room and a children's room with a twin trundle bed (it used to have bunk beds, not sure why they changed, safety perhaps?). This is a nice room for a family of 4-6 as the childen's room has enough room to throw a twin blow up mattress or two on the floor. The room also comes with a mini kitchenette. When I say MINI I mean mini, very small, but enough room to bring snacks, a few cold drinks in the 'fridge, small sink, etc.They offer a breakfast but it's very basic. Danish, bagels, toast, bananas, apples, coffee, juice, milk and THAT'S IT! If that's enough for you, it's great and saves a few bucks as SF is expensive!Also, on Friday night they offer a bbq although they don't advetise it much. Make sure to ask the front desk about it. We forgot all about it and by the time we got back from sightseeing, we missed it.The front desk staff are very knowlegable about the buses, local eateries, etc. Very helpful.The hotel is in a nice area, the Marina District, close to so much: Golden Gate Bridge, Fort Mason, Fisherman's Wharf and everything else is a bus or cable car ride away!!All in all we had a great stay at HDS, as we did before and we will stay again in the future.",28-Aug-08,0,0,5,6,6,4,6,6,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_1112,"Not convinced The hotel does the basics quite well but do not expect too much.The location is a plus, quite central, some nearby shops and reasonably priced cafes and about a 15-20 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf.Breakfast can be a bit sparse and you grab and go, either sitting outside if there is room or take things back to your bedroom. Supplies are replenished but you'll probably need more if you're used to a good breakfast.Rooms can be bit noisy with other guests walking around.There are additional support structures holding up the top 2 floors which are a bit concerning when you arrive.Car parking can be tight and we usually finished up in the overflow area in the next street.Overall adequate, but would probably not stay here again.",14-Aug-08,1,0,3,4,5,4,3,4,2,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_10343,"Value? Our family stayed here for three days and have mixed feelings about the hotel. We loved the location, it was off the beaten path, but close to Union street which had lots to look at and eat. The marina district was fun to get to know and we enjoyed our time away from the hotel. The hotel recently (I guess) has had some issues with structural support or something, because there were exposed support pillars with yellow tape put all over them holding up the second floor. We didn't notice any sagging or dangerous looking cracks, but it wasn't what we expected when arriving. The walls and ceiling were thin in our room and we joked about the dinosaurs wrestling upstairs each night. The pool was small, but the weather wasn't hot enough for that to be an issue. Parking was free, but if you couldn't find a parking space inside the courtyard you had to park next door where there are signs every 10 feet telling you to take everything out of your car which doesn't leave you with the most confident feeling about the neighborhood. Our room was small, but clean and functional. The bathroom was Parisian in size and didn't have space to place our daily toiletries . Breakfast was very basic (coffee, orange juice, rolls) and we ended up eating breakfast away from the hotel to fill up. The overall value of the hotel is questionable. We paid $177 a night thinking we would save money on parking and breakfast, but it didn't work out as well as planned. San Francisco is an expensive place, so I am not sure if there are better places out there for families looking to cut costs. Next time I go to SF I will probably not stay at the Hotel Del Sol.",26-Jul-08,1,1,4,4,5,5,4,4,5,4,$192

Very nice bar b que for the hotel guests on Friday, July 4 that we all enjoyed, didn't know the marina district was so close and so cool. I would definately recommend this hotel again to another large family, the gentleman doing the bar b que and stocking the continental breakfast was incredibly nice.

hotel_102,hotel_7159,"Good hotel for the price If you are accustomed to staying at 4 or 5 star hotels, this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for a clean and spacious room in a quiet motor inn for a reasonable rate, this is a good bet. Our family of 4 stayed in a suite - bedroom and living room with a pullout sofa. The pullout sofas aren't the most comfortable beds in the world but if your kids aren't from The princess and the pea, it is fine. It was nice to have a refrigerator so we could have cold drinks. The bathroom is a bit small but functional and the nice soap and toiletries were a special touch. There is also a safe in one of the closets. At one point the toilet needed a plunger and a handyman showed up at the door within a minute of hanging up the phone.The staff is incredibly helpful and even gave us the addresses for the Mrs. Doubtfire house and the Full House home. Upon check-in there were cookies in the lobby and the morning breakfast (eaten poolside) was a nice way to start the day. The bright decor puts you in a festive mood and the hammocks in the courtyard are a great way to relax. Again, it was amazing how quiet it was at night - I credit the management staff who reminds people upon check -in that they need to be considerate of others (sad that they need to actually tell people that but we're thankful that they do)We walked to everything from here as we do on every vacation but I know that there is a nearby bus stop.

The location is terrific for touring San Francisco by cable car, by foot or by the MUNI. The complimentary BBQ the evening of our arrival was a HUGE plus as was the free parking on premises. This hotel is kid-friendly with a nice sized court yard next to the pool for play. There were two minor issues: 1. The telephones in our room were not operational. 2. The remote controls provided did not operate either of the TV's in our suite. Many of the guests we met were repeat visitors.

The hotel is one of those true motels built around a motor court. It has been updated with vibrant colors and basic but comfortable amenities. For us the location was ideal. Once we pulled into our FREE parking spot, we never used our car again until we left. The hotel clerks were knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. They helped us figure out the public transportation, restaurant reservations and more. At days end the pool was fabulous. It is not huge, but it is clean and has a shallow end for my little one. They provide pool toys, goggles, etc. My kids were satisfied with the basic bagel and pastry breakfast. But the hotel is also very close to many cafes and other restaurants if you want more. If you are looking for luxury, go to Union Square, but if you want a clean, family-friendly place then this is it.

hotel_102,hotel_9353,"Not for older travelers Five of us stayed here in 2 rooms. Two of us were 70 years old at the time of the trip. I would not book them here again. Although there is an elevator, there are still stairs that have to be negotiated once you exit the elevator, regardless of where your room is. This was difficult for the older travelers among us, and something that would keep me from booking them at this hotel again. There is also a big disparity in the size of the rooms. One room was a king. The other had 2 double beds. The double bed room was the smallest hotel room I have been in the US. I would say it was average size for a European hotel room. In contrast the king room had a kitchen with fridge, microwave, utensils, an extra pull out couch, and a big bathroom. Also, both rooms had showers only, which may not work for those with kids who still take baths. On the upside, the location is great, if you don't want to be with the tourist hoards near Ghiradelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf. We have always liked Cow Hollow and chose the hotel for that reason. Our daughter loved the heated pool. Public transportation (bus) is easy from the hotel. The people who work at the hotel are nice and will quiet people down who violate the quiet hours rule. I don't know if I would stay here again, but it may be the best choice in the neighborhood. Free parking is a huge bonus, and when the spots fill up underneath the hotel, they have a lot across the street.",18-Jun-08,0,0,4,3,5,4,4,1,1,4,$192

First night we were awakened frequently second night we turned on the AC and the noise blocked out the outside noise.

I highly recommend purchasing a City Pass which allows free transportation and passes to the Exploratorium and Aquarium of the Bay. Though the hotel isn't located close to the wharf or other areas where you see a lot of hotels, with our City Pass, we found it easy to get anywhere we wanted to go.

The rooms are average-sized and comfortable, the grounds are very nice and the staff are amazing - universally friendly and accommodating. In fact, they are probably the best hotel staff I have encountered in 30 years of traveling. The hotel is in the Cow Hollow/Marina district, which means it is not in the heart of tourist San Francisco; if you're looking for that, you'd be better off booking a hotel near Fisherman's Wharf. What the area around the Hotel del Sol does provide is a lively neighborhood feel with tons of nice restaraunts, parks and shops within easy walking distance. The only remotely negative thing about this hotel is that it does cater to families with children, which means that occasionally you will run into parents who think vacation means that they don't have to discipline their children. We were on the second floor, and the children in the room above us were practicing their skateboard jumps at 10 p.m. I called the front desk, and the problem was taken care of immediately - another example of the great service we found at this hotel.

The property isn't as nice as it used to be and they no longer offer Aveda products (which was one of my favorite things before). Sound carries quite a bit so ask for a room on the top floor if available. Rooms are small but clean and the furnishings are starting to become a bit dated. Also, the picture on our TV was very poor - we couldn't watch a couple of the channels. Parking is included - which is a great feature for SF - and the location is great - walking distance to many shops and restaurants in a pretty trendy area.

hotel_102,hotel_6937,"Fun Hotel but there must be better places to stay We chose the Hotel del Sol for our 5 day stay in San Francisco on the basis that the reviews indicated it might be fun for our two boys (9 and 17) , that it had a pool and because it had free parking. In fact Hotel de Sol is a motel rather than a hotel and the fact that all the rooms overlook a central public courtyard means that all are inherently noisy. Fortunately during our stay the other guests were not making much noise, but I could imagine that if you were unlucky and your stay co-incided with that of a rowdy group, it could be pretty unpleasant. The pool is very small and not really worthwhile, and whilst on site car parking was a great bonus I think that next time I would get rid of the hire car when reaching San Francisco and get by using public transport. That said a drive out to Muir Wood is well worth while. The hotel location is not good. It is not near anything of interest. Admittedly the bus stop is only two blocks away, but you have to use the bus to go everywhere, which is time consuming.The staff were superb. Very friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel provides a light breakfast, even though it does not have the facilities to do so. You get your bagels and coffee from reception and the sit by the pool. The buildings and rooms are colourful and jolly, and a big benefit for us was that the price was such that we could afford to have two rooms rather than having to share a room with our boys. On reflection though it would have been better to have found a hotel in Fisherman's Wharfe (I'm not sure which however as none stood out as looking particularly welcoming).We took a night trip to Alcatraz which was fantastic - one of the best tourist trips I have ever done. The boys also really enjoyed the Exploratorium (Science Museum).People had warned my that San Fracisco would be cold, but I hadn't really believed them. We left Sacramento (80 miles inland) with the temperature at 95 F, and when we got to San Francisco it was only 60 F. It stayed like that all week. This was, however, a welcome relief from the heat we had experienced during the remainder of our trip.Overall, although Hotel del Sol is great fun, my advice would be to find a hotel in either Fisherman's Wharfe or Union Square.",2-Nov-07,4,4,4,4,2,4,6,5,1,4,$192

The 1950's motor lodge style hotel and the rooms are brightly colored, what I would call art-deco. There is a nice courtyard with a small pool. The pool was quite chilly for adults but my kids, ages 4  7 didn't seem to mind. The afternoon cookies and milk were also a hit. Back to the room. I won't deny that the room is quite small and the bathroom consisted of a pedistal sink, shower stall, and commode. That said, who comes to San Francisco to stay in their room?!! The beds were very comfortable and the boutique soaps and shampoos were a treat. Our room overlooked Greenwich Street so we didn't get the traffic noise I read in other reviews. We were also on the top floor which probably helped in that area as well. The hotel was fully booked but the little bit of noise we heard died down by 10 pm. Continental breakfasts were standard fare but in a city where you pay big $$ to eat, any free breakfast is a bonus. The biggest appeal to me was the location. The marina/Cow Hollow district is a wonderful,safe location. There are kid friendly restaurants within walking distance such as Mel's Drive-In Diner and Amici's Pizzeria along Lombard St. If you want something that offers a quieter dining experience with delicious adult fare as well as a kid menu, Perry's on Union St. is also great. Parking is FREE at Hotel Del Sol but a car in SF is unnecessary. We bought MUNI passes for each of us (kids under 5 ride free). The bus stop is a few blocks from the hotel. Since it is a main line, we were able to go everywhere with ease. The neighborhood is very safe, great for evening strolls and the hotel is within walking distance to the Presidio, Chrissy Field, The Exploratorium, and the Palace of Fine Arts. Walking around the neighborhoods looking at the architecture also is a San Francisco must-see. On a final note, I have to say the staff at the Hotel Del Sol is what really makes this place stand out. I had booked a rental car for the day we were checking out and heading to Yosemite. There was a problem with Enterprise (what a nightmare). When Jorge heard of our problem, he offered to call other rental car companies for us and after an hour located a car with Avis. He also allowed us to keep our room until Avis came to pick us up which was almost 4 pm. The others at the Front desk were also so very helpful. They have pocket size maps there that are invaluable.

An outdoor pool, parking and a small continental breakfast was also part of the deal. It definitely had a European feel and that may have been because it seemed to be mostly European travelers staying there. The price was incredibly reasonable and we'll definitely be back.

And while there were some nice things about it (I'll get to those), overall we were quite disappointed. The whole time I was there, I kept thinking, I can't wait to write a review of this place on TripAdvisor.  The main problem was the tiny, cramped rooms (at least the one we had, it was a standard-type room with 2 queen beds). Everyone's face fell when we first walked in. It was claustrophobic. I have re-read many of the reviews now that I'm back, and even many of the favourable ones do mention the small rooms.The bathroom was equally cramped, with only space for a shower stall. This disappointed me further, as I am a bath person. Another disappointment was the lack of a fridge, something we always appreciate in a hotel room.Another disappointment was the size of the swimming pool (not much bigger than a bathtub) and the cold temperature of the water.The courtyard itself was nicely done up, in particular at night with the lights on the palm trees. Breakfast was fairly uninteresting (continental style danishes etc.), but I'm not really complaining here -- I'd rather have a simple breakfast than none at all. Cookies offered every afternoon at 4:00 were appreciated by my kids. Another thing I did like was the hair products, moisturizer and soaps.

I realize San Francisco is very expensive, and that parking is included (which is a big deal), however, it is still overpriced. On the plus side, it is extremely well located, and the people at the desk, as well as housekeeping, were lovely.

When we arrived from the UK we discovered that our booking was for 2008, not 2007 (oops!), but the guy on reception didn't bat an eyelid. He put us in a 'spare' room (we were so tired after the flight we didn't really care where we went...) and then moved all our stuff into a better room the morning after. When I was awake at 4am (time difference etc etc) the very cheerful night porter made me coffee to go. With 2 young children in tow we were so grateful that our mistake was sorted out so easily and without fuss - 10/10 Hotel del Sol!The hotel is tidy and neat, bright and cheerful. There is good family dining very close by (Mel's Diner, pizza, chinese, japanese etc) and a very short walk to excellent public transport links. It is also a very easy and pleasant walk along the front to the Fisherman's Wharfe area and all the touristy bits.San Francisco was cool and misty, so the hotel pool was equally cool, but it was still great to go for a dip and a splash with the kids.Breakfast was standard fare (juice, coffee, bagels/cream cheese, pastries and fruit) and more than adequate. Staff were all cheerful, friendly and, in our case, went out of their way to sort out our 'little' error.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone wanting no-frills, comfortable accomodation away from the city centre hustle and bustle, but close enough to get there easily.",2-Sep-07,0,0,6,5,5,6,6,6,1,4,$192

We loved the neighborhood (happy to be out of the Union Square buzz) and found the the Hotel Del Sol staff could direct us by bus anywhere we wanted to go. We walked a lot, found great local restaurants and a great organic type supermarket all nearby. We also had the suite room (separate spaces for adults and kids).

hotel_102,hotel_5960,"decent hotel Decent hotel, includes parking and a simple breakfast (bagels with cream cheese  jam, coffee, hot chocolate, tea, milk, orange juice), cookies in afternoon. One clerk was very friendly, another less so. Food recommendations were blah (pasta place -- forgot it's name, was ho-hum, sandwich place (submarines) was also very average). Pool was freezing cold. Elevator brightly painted, jolts to a stop. To reach room on 3d floor, need to go up/down a few steps (warning to strollers). Bathroom had only a shower, but that was okay. Nice shampoo/hand cream. Parking was tight (but included). Room was brightly coloured and cheerful, clean with adequate storage.We were quoted $189 over the phone in June, when we arrived, someone in front of us got the same kind of room (2 dbl beds) for $129. So, I asked for and got that price. Check before checking in!",22-Aug-07,1,0,5,4,5,4,5,4,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_10335,"Good option for families We booked 3 nights at the Hotel del Sol largely because of its reputation as a family-friendly place, and by-and-large were not disappointed. We had a room with a queen bed, and another room (which may have been a converted bathroom) that was very small but our 5 and 6 year-olds loved the trundle bed and the age-appropriate children's decorations. We also asked for a crib for our 1 year-old and although space was a little tight, we were all reasonably comfortable.The afternoon cookies and milk were a hit, as was the courtyard pool (although the wind at times was pretty fierce). Breakfast was really nothing special, but the chance to start our day with coffee and pastries/bagels while we spent a leisurely morning planning our day was invaluable!Location can't be beat, and regarding the noise and thin walls - our solution was turn on the air conditioning/heating unit at night. The white noise drowned out a lot (although we never were too bothered by noise) and made sleeping more comfortable.The staff were friendly and even let me park on the small lawn in the courtyard when available parking was tight. All in all, the positives outweighed the slight negatives (smallish rooms, some oddities in room structure/size). For those families with unlimited budgets, a fancy hotel suite near Union Square might be more stylish, but the Hotel Del Sol is a very good option if you're on a budget and don't mind a little funkiness!",20-Aug-07,0,0,4,4,5,4,5,4,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_10338,"Stay away if noise bothers you The Hotel Del Sol is okay for what it is. However if noise is an issue, this is not the hotel for you.We enjoyed the use of colour in attempting to convert a 60's motel into something more current. However, at the end fo the day, it remains a 60's motel. No bathtub. No hooks in the bathroom. Over three days, used up bath soap was not replaced. Too few electrical outlets resulting is so many things added to an outlet that I started to worry.Rooms were small so that even at $229 for a one bedroom, 3 people were cramped. Breakfast was coffee, juice, fruit and either overly sweet doughnuts (for breakfast????) or little bagels that had to be cut with a bagel cutter that did more to mash the bagel. And the NOISE!!!!! If you kept all of your windows closed, it was okay. However, with a slightly open window, you were kept awake at night by street traffic, arguments in the street or hotel guests noisily departing at 6:45am. Even with your windows closed, if you were so unfortunate to stay at the hotel as a group of middle aged folks on motor cycles, who loved to rev or even idle their hogs, the entire building literally shook.$7.99 per day for internet. OUCH!For the price, I was not impressed.However, location is always a plus and one of Hotel Del Sol's advantages is its accessibility to key areas of the City. One and one half short blocks away a #30 Muni bus will take you to Fisherman's Wharf (except for the trip to Alcatraz, why you would want to go there, I don't know) in five to ten minutes and to Union Square in 20-25 minutes while passing through North Beach and Chinatown and great views of Alcatraz and Coit Tower on Telelgraph Hill along the way. The trip alone is worth the price of a ticket. If you will have a car, free parking is a major plus to be factored into the price.A friendly and helpful day and afternoon staff. Night staff could not tell me how to access messages.The hotel is close to the fun restaurants of Chestnut Street and an easy walk from the upscale shops of Union Street.So, for the location and the free parking, and if you want to keep your windows closed at all times and avoid their breakfast and the internet, it is a reasonable choice.",18-Aug-07,0,0,3,3,5,4,5,5,3,4,$192

My kids were very welcome there, the breakfast was amazing, and they even have a generous spread of cheese, crackers, wine, etc on Friday afternoons. There are warm cookies for the kids every afternoon. We felt very welcome there. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was very spacious with two large closets. I have two minor complaints-- the walls are very thin, and the mattress we had sagged a little.

hotel_102,hotel_5698,"Great for families arriving in SF by car Our family arrived via minivan for five days in SF. I booked a room here based on being able to have a two-room suite and the generally excellent reviews the hotel receives in guidebooks. We found during our stay at the Hotel Del Sol that it exceeded our high expectations in almost every way. The longer we were there, the better we liked it. Those downgrading the hotel either 1) expected it to be something it's not (i.e. a posh hotel, a place in the middle of walkable tourist areas, something w/rooms resembling a Hampton or Quality inn--it pretends to be none of these) or 2) need to use the forum to register some minor beef that most people absorb as part of the normal hassles of traveling, esp with a family. That said, here's our experience w/four people.The general feel of the hotel is really nice and, for a city, very safe. Instead of the courtyard making things seems overly noisy and familiar, which is what I expected, the grounds outside came to feel familiar and homey. Our children are not urban-savvy kids. It was nice to be in a city and not spend our time watching their backs, as we would have to do in any Union Square, or even Fisherman's Wharf, location. There were lots of European travelers staying here; I understand why: if you're arriving from another country, it's a very reassuring place and location in which to land.There are fabulous places to walk and eat either two blocks to the north or two to the south. There's also fast food (taco bell, the colonel's chicken) w/in a block. There's small grocery stores a block away and one of the city's best Safeways five blocks away. There's one of the best running routes I've ever been on right out the door toward the marina and the GG bridge (the SF marathon goes along the route). There's a park one block away. There's easy car access to the bridge, Golden Gate Park, and the rest of the city, if you're inclined to drive and park other places. I can't imagine a better location in which to stay, unless you need to walk out the door and be in the middle of everything. (Having lived in NYC, we likened staying here to the equivalent of getting a hotel on the upper-west-side of NYC, out of the throng of mid-town.)Plenty has been written about the rooms, the great breakfast (w/the consistently best breakfast coffee we've ever had) and other stuff, so I'll not add to that. Our only beef, room-wise, was terrible shower water pressure. Don't know if that was a city-pipe, hotel-pipe, or shower-head issue.All in all, I'd return to the HDS in a heartbeat, though would make my reservations as early as possible so I could claim just the configuration in a suite I wanted, as they are all laid out a bit differently.",10-Aug-07,0,0,5,5,6,6,6,6,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_3142,"Okay, Not Amazing We booked this hotel after reading all the super positive reviews here on TripAdvisor, and after viewing the hotel's own website...We were disappointed. The pros: Great location in the Marina District with great restaurants and the waterfront within short walking distance. We loved the Marina neighborhood and loved being away from the more touristed areas of the city. The hotel is perky, pretty and fun--on the outside. Good quality bagels and pastries and fresh bananas for breakfast. We did enjoy this morning meal.The cons: We had a room with 2 full beds (not 2 queens). Bedding was average, not the best comfort. Really, this hotel was only comfortable for the 2 nights we stayed there. The room was fairly small, the bathroom: very small. Also, the bathroom was in sorry shape, with rust evident and a worn, small shelf. No hand-held shower. Really, the bathroom reminded me of college apartment digs. Quirky and funky can be okay, but when I travel, I want to feel comfortable and clean in the bathroom.The front desk guys were young, and a bit cavalier to my taste. I mean, they were nice enough... There was just not a level of professionalism that let me feel I was in competent hands.Overall, this is a good choice for a quick visit...nothing to get too excited about. I traveled with my husband and young daughter. I don't know what all the fuss is regarding this being the best family choice in SanFran.I don't mean to be a nay-sayer...We simply didn't find this to be the outstanding place it is hyped as.

hotel_102,hotel_8954,"Excellent Family Choice We stayed four nights at Hotel Del Sol during a 10-day California trip with my wife and two daughters - ages 7 and 8. We booked in advance into one of the two room suites, which worked perfectly for us and was well worth the few extra dollars. The beds (even the pull-out!!) were very comfortable, and the DVD player was a nice surprise. Only issue we had was a lack of closet space and a very tiny bathroom- but we coped with both just fine. We enjoyed the continental breakfast every morning, and were pleasantly surprised by the variety and quality of the food - especially for a complimentary breakfast. My daughters made there way into the pool a couple of times despite the eary June chilly days.The location was OK, a very safe neighborhood that doesn't feel too crowded. However, it did take a bit of patience on occasion to get a taxi or to catch the bus. Best bet is to call down to the front desk 5-10 minutes before you want to leave and have them call you a cab and it should be there waiting when you get down. We ate in one of the restaurants in the area, which was recommended as a casual family place by the front desk, but we were unimpressed. There were several places very close by that I would have loved to try, but didn't look great for kids.The free, convenient parking was a big plus. Several commented about the overflow lot. This was not a problem at all as it was just across the street.

The front desk people were so helpful and kind, the location was great (between lots of dining options on Chestnut and Union Streets) and we appreciated the ease of the Hotel Del Sol--not in the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area, etc. The bus system was confusing to us at first, but once we got the hang of it, we traveled all over the city. We also rented a car to get out of the city for a few day trips.Every night was quiet except for Saturday night when the bars got out (we were with our two year old and so had early bedtimes and rising times). We stayed in a small suite and we felt that it was a good value for the money. Unfortunately, the cribs they had were pack and plays which were too small for our child, but overall this was a good family place to stay. The front desk loaned us a few Sesame Street videos and books for a particularly fussy evening. Like other reviews mention, The Hotel Del Sol is really a glorified motel, but it feels clean, safe, quiet and accomodating.

It is quirky that you drive your car into the courtyard for covered parking. The continental breakfast is nice, but look out for incoming cars as you are sitting at tables in the courtyard!

When we first arrived, I was disappointed because it really is more 'motel' than 'hotel'. I was nervous that the thin walls  proximity to the street would make for noisy, sleepless nights. Not so! We never had a significant problem with noise(we did hear some foot traffic on the stairs in the morning, but we were usually awake by then, anyway) Hotel Del Sol is very clean and comfortable. Nice bedding and we loved those Aveda products! The staff was wonderful  very helpful. Also, appreciated the free parking. My kids loved: the milk  cookies in the afternoon(warm, chewy cookies), the hammock  the pool. We skipped the breakfasts, because there are so many great breakfast spots in the neighborhood  we'd rather drink cappuccino than regular coffee. I'm so glad we didn't stay in some tourist trap like Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf because I think you get a better sense of the city in a place like this. We loved the neighborhood, which is pretty laid back, but full of shopping  food options  walking distance to plenty of sites, like Crissy Field  Fisherman's Wharf(longish walk, but totally do-able) I'd definitely stay there again with my kids (but would opt for something more refined if it were just me  my husband).",12-Apr-07,8,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,$192

I was very suprised because we had arrived early and did not ask to be upgraded. What a way to start off the trip!

hotel_102,hotel_1283,"Lovely Staff and Area Rooms Disappointing We booked this hotel based on previous reviews. Firstly, the main reason for booking this hotel was their bunk bed family suite rooms as our children are a girl and a boy ages 12 and 14 and too big for the usual pull out trundle beds, hence, it was great to find a hotel with such rooms. We had a few problems with our booking, when we arrived at the hotel we were advised that infact, these rooms no longer exist and the receptionist advised us that someone should have informed us of this at the time of booking (bearing in mind that we phoned up and booked three months previous and specifically asked for the bunk bed room, at the time we were actually at the hotel end Dec 2006 to Jan 3rd 2007 these rooms were still advertised on their web site). The staff at this hotel are faultless, infact, possibly the most friendly and helpful staff I have ever come across the reception staff are excellent as are the cleaning staff and the general porters. I do have to say though that overall I was disappointed with The Hotel Del Sol, I don't quite get the hype with this hotel, it quite literally is just a bog standard motel and not even as brightly coloured and outrageous as I had expected I guess. As previously mentioned the rooms are fairly noisy there is alot of traffic noise from late evening and early morning when you hear the buses and lorries, infact, we could hear so much outside noise that you would swear that your windows weren't properly shut! The motel is fairly compact and each part of the hotel is serviced by rear outside stairs, and there is a constant stream of guests and staff up and down the stairs at all hours, and also as previously mentioned, the noise from the heating/air conditioning from your neighbouring room will drive you crazy. The toilets at the hotel constantly blocked up so much so that we no longer went and asked for a plunger! we went to the broom cupboard and helped ourselves as the need for one was so frequent! When we finally checked out of the hotel the receptionist was kind enough to deduct a couple of dollars from our bill due to the inconvenience we had at not getting the bunk bed room which was a nice gesture. But I can honestly say that we will be in San Francisco again this year but we won't be staying at the Hotel Del Sol again, it just isn't value for money and for this money I expect a little more room comfort, space and quietness and above all a little undisturbed sleep!!!",8-Jan-07,9,7,4,3,5,5,6,6,1,4,$192

It is located in the Marina district, which is home to great shops and restaurants....all that you can easily walk to.

I don't think you could get a better value for the money in that location. We took the city bus (a stop is located just 2 short blocks away) everywhere. It's easy to get around in San Francisco without a car! One thing we did that was awesome was.....rent bikes from Blazing Saddles Bikes and bike across the Golden Gate Bridge to Saulsalito!

The hotel isn't the most luxorious, but the rooms are really comfy and spotlessly clean and the staff were great. We were torn between staying near the touristy area of Fishermans Wharf and paying extra for the 'privilege' , or saving money by staying further out at H.D.S. After spending a couple of nights at H.D.S. and visiting Fishermans Wharf we were so happy we chose not to stay in the tourist area, it was so tacky and the restaurants we tried weren't that good, unless all you want to eat is chowder. Hotel Del Sol is in Cow Hollow and very close to Union St, which is a fantastic area full of small restaurants and bars mostly full of locals. Try and get to eat at least once at Beetelnut, be sure to make a reservation at least a day in advance as it's always packed and serves fabulous food. It's easy to get around with the public transport system so that wasn't a problem, a ten minute ride to Union Square and all the shopping.

But the staff was very friendly and it was no problem to check in early when we came, and to get a late check out when we left.So overall, we can recommend this hotel.",23-Sep-06,3,3,5,5,5,5,6,6,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_3311,"Nice hotel in good area Spent three nights here in JulyAlthough it's basically a motel done up, it's got a certain charm, particularly if you like your colours bright.The hotel is kid friendly. We enjoyed NOT being right in the center of SF - having some outdoor space and pool (even though it is on the small side and right by the road ).Our kids particularly liked the evening milk and cookies. Two months later they're still talking about them!Location is also good for the Exploratorium (which is fantastic for kids) the delights of Union St and Chestnut St and a short ride to the cable car / Fisherman's wharf.You could pay more and get a nicer room somewhere more central, but Hotel del Sol is a great value place to be based",8-Sep-06,3,3,5,3,5,4,5,4,2,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_2174,"We loved Hotel Del Sol We had a great stay at Hotel Del Sol. At first I was disappointed with the room, it was nicely decorated but the hotel is definitely a motor lodge. Issues with ventilation, noise, etc. But I soon became smitten with the friendly staff  special touches: aveda skin products, friday afternoon reggae barbecue, palm trees lit at night with hammocks below, world music being pumped into the elevator, each room named (ours was the young  the restless), the courtyard with swimming pool  small grassy area...and the free parking didn't hurt either! The best part of Hotel Del Sol is the location: right in the heart of the marina between Union  Chestnut Street. We were travelling with our 2 year old son and he had a ball: there is an excellent neighborhood park right nearby, and we took him in his stroller all around the Marina, Chrissy Field, Fishermans Wharf.I would definitely recommend Hotel Del Sol.",27-Aug-06,3,3,5,3,6,4,5,5,1,4,$192

As some posts have also said that it is just a motor lodge, and yes it is, but it has a charm of its own and being a old fifties style motor court only adds to that.

hotel_102,hotel_10314,"Wonderful location , great value This delightful hotel is one of those gems that we only found out about by using Trip Advisor.It is in a great location in the trendy Marina district. We felt rather smug when we saw other tourists paying through their noses to stay in the usual chain hotels in the Fishmen's Wharf area - we were where the trendy peole are and we were getting a great deal as well ! Our room was simple with bright soft furnishings but very clean. Our bathroom was perfectly adequate albeit a little small. Our children thought the milk and cookies at 7 a great idea even if they are teenagers and hadn't yet had supper !The continental breakfasts were fine - there are a limited number of tables around the pool and some guests did tend to hog them for longer than was appropriate either while waiting for other members of their party to surface or to simply sit at the table planning that days sightseeing. But that is a very minor gripe.The hotel is situated in a great area - there are plenty of nice bars and restaurants within a few blocks. We walked to Ghiardelli Square by day and back in the evening and felt completely safe throughout. From Little Italy and Chinatown there is a direct bus that goes right along Union Street to within a few blocks of the hotel which was very convenient..When we arrived we were in need of a laudry to get some clean clothes - the very pleasant and helpful front desk staff recommended a Chinese laundry close by that was wonderful.Don't expect fancy rooms and flash facilities but as a reasonably priced base from which to explore this wonderful city this hotel would be hard to beat. We arrived there from the over the top 5 star luxury of the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas and enjoyed our stay at the Hotel del Sol just as much.",11-Aug-06,1,1,6,5,6,6,6,6,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_2575,"Still maintaining its high standards This is a hot off the press review as we only left today! The hotel came as absolutely no surprise as it accurately reflected the high standards of the previous reviews. The only trouble with giving it rave reviews is that more of you folk will visit and make future reservations difficult to get. Actually, we have already made them and that is recommendation enough for the Hotel Del Sol. An even more credible recomendation is that the 3 teenage kids thought it was cool, how often do parents and kids agree about anything!

The pool is in shade all day, which didn't seem to bother the kids who splashed around in it all morning and evening.Good coffee and bagels in the morning (although why stay at the hotel for breakfast when so many great little places for eggs are right around the corner on Chestnust Street?) And in the evening, warm cookies and milk for families.We had a great sleep, nice time. Not much in terms of services but a GREAT FRIENDLY staff. What do they do to these guys?

hotel_102,hotel_7519,"Perfect for Families Two nights at the Hotel del Sol was an enjoyable experience for our entire family (mother, father, daughter-14, son -12). The hotel staff was exceptionally accomodating and friendly. After the first night we requested to move to the 2nd floor due to the frolic of a 3 year old overhead, and were met with zero friction. The rooms are average size, brightly decorated and clean. The grounds have a fun, sunny feel to them. The pool is a nice bonus. We did not waste time lying around it but my son did enjoy swimming while my daughter and I walked to nearby shops. My family did give me an A+ on location. Although it is not central, it is in the trendy Marina Distict., a local that is chocked full of fantiastic neighborhood restaurants and bars. We love this feel so much more than tourist traps. If you go BE SURE to have a meal (or two) at The Grove corner of Chestnut and hmmmm...I forget., but believe me it is worth any research- Any local would know. Another favorite was Andele (same street as The Grove) Mexican Cantina. I do feel like the Hotel del Sol is a definate find!!",27-Jul-06,4,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_2443,"Golden Gate Greeter program a real winner with Hotel De Sol I had looked at trip advisor reviews prior to booking Hotel De Sol and booked directly through the hotel. The hotel was great, not flash, but very comfortable and offered everything my family of 5 needed to make our stay comfortable.The union street shops up the road had some lovely restuarants to eat at, and the bus was only a block away , which made travelling easy. Free parking for our car was a bonus, as was breakfast, as looking for a place to eat with 3 children is not fun early in the morning.The offer of a guded tour by a local through the Golden Gate Greeter program was the main reason I chose this chain of hotels and I am so please we took the opportunity. Our greeter, Bob, was a lovely person who gave frrely of his time and knowledge about San Franscisco. It was great having a local's insite into the city and having someone take us to the sites made it so much easier to get to them without the aggravation of finding our way around unfamiliar territory.I would highly recommend the hotel for htose that are happy to be a liitle out of 'downtown' and the Golden Gate Greeter is a must for any tourist!

She got to check out videos, books and games from their closet at the front desk. Her favorite part was the chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon. We hung out on the hammock and at the pool.

Bathroom was definitely tiny but very clean and functional, especially the shower. We enjoyed our stay at the Del Sol. The location is really great if you want to enjoy the upscale neighborhoods of Marina, Cow Hollow or Pacific Heights. There are many restaurants, bars, shops and playgrounds a short walk from the hotel. Being able to park the car for free in San Francisco is definitely a plus as most hotels charge $30 or more for parking. Breakfast was OK but don't expect too much. Same for service.

hotel_102,hotel_9512,"Very good hotel Stayed in a double double room at the Del Sol for 4 nights in April (2 adults and 2 children 11 and 13).The room and bathroom were very clean and tidy, the shower was good. There was a good walk-in wardrobe for storage and a safe. The beds were comfortable and the decor was groovy. The room was just a bit too small for 4 people and if your budget can stretch a suite or familly room would be worth it. It was also great to have a heated pool for the kids which was available to use from 8am to 10pm the kids did not need to be supervised and could seen from our bedroom window. The location was good, a 15-20 minute walk to Pier 39 or a $10 taxi ride for 4. There were restaurants near by and a post office just around the corner. If your lucky you could get parking within the court yard of the hotel, otherwise there is additional parking next to the hotel. You can walk along Lombard Street up a very steep hill to 'The Crookedest St' part and catch the cable cars (trolley) to the cable car museum and on to Union Square thus avoiding 30-60 minute queues at the terminus. It is worth getting a one day travel pass $11 per person which can be used on the cable cars, street cars and buses all day otherwise you pay as you get on an off.

hotel_102,hotel_6103,"(Almost) Perfect Hidden Jewel This quirky, funky hotel was a great base for our week-long visit (Jan 15-21, 2006) to the city. Since it is actually a converted motel, parking is provided (at no addl. fee) to guests: a big plus in this city! Although the place is older (50s), it is well maintained. The decor is bright and airy. There are just over 50 rooms and I think that most of them overlook the courtyard (small pool, bistro tables, vending machines) Our room had two comfortable queen-size beds, a small table, two chairs, an entertainment center that held the TV and a VCR and had 4 small drawers, a large walk-in closet with a personal safe and a small bathroom (no bathtub.) There was an exposed ventilating fan above the shower stall. The fan was extremely dusty/grimy and looked like it had never been cleaned. The water pressure in the shower was the big disappointment to us. Honestly, it was so slight that it was difficult to rinse one's hair of the shampoo and conditioner. The heating/cooling unit ! is efficient and modern (although it was slightly loud.) One can see the daylight around the closed door of the room though since there are large gaps between the door and the frame. We were on the third floor; there were two staircases at either end of the floor. There is also an old, tiny elevator near the reception area. We were lucky to fit the two of us and our suitcases in the unit, and it moves slowly. We only used the elevator when we transported our luggage though. The staff is friendly and helpful. Although a continental breakfast is provided to all guests every morning, we wanted a full breakfast one day and one of the staff suggested a place within walking distance. It was great: good food, selection, portions, and prices!There were a couple of nights that were noisy (one can hear toilets flushing, doors closing, etc. on a regular basis but those noises fade into the background once you get used to them) because of some rowdy folks but, overall, the noise is ge! nerally contained. There are signs posted around the hotel that request that folks keep the noise down during the night. The location-in the marina section of SF-was convenient to shops, Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, public transportation, etc. This place is not the lap of luxury but it is wicked comfortable and very reasonably priced. I would return to the Hotel Del Sol if the price was right again (although I'd worry about rinsing my hair . . . )",23-Jan-06,17,15,6,4,1,5,1,6,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_3313,"Great Family Hotel We chose the Hotel del Sol because it was rated as the #1 family hotel in SF in a book we picked up @ BN. Although it was not perfect, the positives far outweighed the negatives.Negatives first. We stayed for a week in the family suite. There was no dresser to place our clothes, and the closet was tiny. So our clothes stayed in the suitcases. Second, they need a TV in the kid's room (the 5 of us fought over the only one located in the main room). Finally, they only had a shower in the bathroom...no tub. This made it difficult to keep our toddler clean, since he's used to baths and did NOT like the shower. All in all, no big deals with the negatives. Just suggestions for improvement.The del Sol is in a great location. We were there a week and never once used our car. The Exploratorium is an easy walk in one direction (northwest I think) and Fisherman's Wharf is an easy walk the other direction. There is a GREAT playground about 200 yards from the hotel. The area is safe and the people are friendly. If you need to go farther or just don't like to walk, the #30 bus, which has a stop about 50 yards from the hotel, goes just about everywhere in the city. Purchase the citypass (we did online before making the trip) and you can ride all the buses, trolleys, cable cars, etc. free for 7 days. SF is an incredible city, and the del Sol is a wonderful place to stay to enjoy it. We plan on many more visits in the future.",17-Jan-06,18,16,4,5,1,5,1,5,1,4,$192

The pool/courtyard was great. The free breakfast was decent. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. He pointed us to a great restaurant only a couple of blocks away.

hotel_102,hotel_7472,"Wonderful Place! I was incredibly impressed with this motel. The most comfortable bed I've ever slept on (manager even sent me the name of the company so I can buy one myself), fantastic colors, palms and bamboo, huge hammocks, aveda toiletries, handmade soaps, large walk-in closet, great desk area, a comfortable sitting area, nice art, terrific bathroom. No issue at all to get an extra (comfy) rollaway for our toddler. The cleaning team was the absolute best, adding more aveda daily and even folding our toddlers' blankie up with his bear on top. In fact, the entire staff was impressive. The cabana parking lot was terrific. Loved the view down from the balcony. and great coffee there all day. They gave our toddler a beach ball and sunglasses for the pool - he loved this place too, as did my husband. Cow Hollow is a beautiful residential urban neighborhood where we could walk to everything.Anything bad, anything?...ok, if only the muffins were homemade. That's about it.Honestly, I loved this place so much that I think every hotel owner/manager should be required to stay here every once in a while to understand how excellent a renovation can be and the value of an excellent staff.Before going to SF, it was a toss-up btwn here and Castle Inn, and I'm so glad we chose Hotel Del Sol. Just fantastic. They earned lifetime customers out of us, and I have a hard time imagining someone who wouldn't like this hotel. Can't wait to go back.",20-Nov-05,11,11,6,6,1,6,1,6,1,4,$192 
hotel_102,hotel_9882,"WE LOVED THE Del Sol!! Husband and I just spent 3/wonderful nights in San Fran at a great little find of a motel - the Hotel del Sol....this place is the best kept secret in San Fran! This is not a big fancy hotel, with big lobby, doorman and all that fancy overpriced stuff. This is an adorable colorful hotel I believe from the 1950's or 60's that was remodeled and the end result is simply breathtaking! You feel like you walked onto the set of Miami Vice in the tropics. So colorful, great hot colors of pinks, blues, yellows, pastel. Wonderful painted elevator, beautiful colorful tiled courtyard with beautiful trees, hammocks, fun heated pool. The rooms are very large, clean and again so bright and cheerful. Wicker furniture, soft down comforters and pillows. A walk-in closet with safe, great clean bathroom with good selection of shampoos and soaps. PLUS real ART and great photographs hanging on the walls. Also a vcr for your to rent any videos free of charge from the main lobby. All the rooms have great colorful tiles on the doors with the room numbers - so artsy and very colorful. Great little fruit treets on each of the floors outside the room. This place is so pretty - and just very special. The staff was wonderful and will do anything to make your trip worthwhile. The best is the FREE PARKING which is a miracle for San Fran. Wonderful breakfast in the morning too. Lot's of bagels, cheeses, jams, eggs, juices and coffee and the set-up is just very beautiful. Someone at this hotel must be an artist or someone very creative. Just really nice special touches all over this hotel!! The neighborhood is very nice too. Some of the best restaurants were found just a block in either direction. This motel is close to Lombard Street with the crooked street. Also Union Street is just like 2/blocks up with great sights to see and wonderful shops! I have been all over the world and I have to say this was a pleasant surprise to find a tiny little place like this with so many personal touches to it. If you go to San Fran. you have to stay here. From the free parking, to the wonderful art, landscape grounds with the pretty twinkle lights at night, nice breakfast and beach-style rooms you just can't ask for anything more! When you drive a short distance down to Fishermans Wharf and you see all the overcrowded, high price hotels and motels all crammed in together it really makes this place feel like you are home.

hotel_102,hotel_3528,"Good family hotel We were in San Francisco as tourists for 3 nights at the Hotel Del Sol. You must accept it for what it is...an older motor inn given a fresh coat of paint. The paint is no longer so fresh, but the rooms are reasonably clean. It is a bargain for a family of 6 as we were...a two room suite (Queen bed plus a small bunk room), free breakfast (the same each day so we spiced it up with selections from local bakeries a short walk away) and a small pool. The location is great...in Cow Hollow just a short walk from trendy Union Street and a bit longer walk (but quite do-able) from Lombard Street, the Marina District, Fishermans Wharf and North Beach/Chinatown. Free parking is worth $20-30 in the city. It was in centrally located in the city but still fairly quiet at night and more of a neighborhood setting...they even loan (for free) videos of movies set in SF! One warning...SF in the summer can be quiet cool (60's) especially when the fog comes in and the wind blows (the only good view of the Golden Gate Bridge I had for 3 days in July was when driving over it!) so be prepared with a light jacket or fleece and long pants!

I had searched and searched and as an avid traveller as well as extreme bargain hunter I was very happy to find this hotel.This is a funky older hotel from the 1950's that a lovely (I am sure gay, not that there's anything wrong with that) group of folks totally rennovated. As to the room basics it follows the standard 50's motor court shape, with doors and windows facing a center courtyard, small pool, and parking underneath (FREE parking, as compared to some hotels that charge $20 to $40/night). The bathroom was very 50's, tile, small and shower. The rooms are 50's motor court size, which was fine for myself and child in two beds. Nice bright accents, paint and accessories have been added to give it a cute and modern feel without sacrificing its retro cool. Great art, furniture and bedding give it a warm, mod feel. Staff was exceptional - very friendly and helpful with directions, etc. And you even get a free continental breakfast - note there are no coffee makers in the room which is fine with the included breakfast. also lots of towels, upscale toiletries and a FREE video library featuring movies made in San Francisco. And the pool was heated but it was too cold outside to use. a bit about the neighborhood, this is an area called Cow Hollow that is a good area, and there are restaurants and a nice shopping area on Union street close by. Its a great urban spot with upscale folks and their associated local grocery stores, hamburger shops and yoga studios. Convenient to Fishermans wharf (do not walk, drive or take public transport) - close to the Marina district, golden gate bridge, crissy field, and the presidio and not far from north beach, chinatown and market street. thanks to the staff - perfect price, perfect spot. we will DEFINATELY be back.

The people at the front desk were wonderful, polite, helpful, really nice consistently. My trip back to the airport was a breeze since they arranged everything on time, with a good company. The furniture is nice and practical, but the hallways smelled terrible. The rooms were not cleaned optimally and inconsistently things like soap, coffee etc were replaced. The room has a small kitchen and all the appropriate appliances, which I think it is a plus, but the room itself is somewhat crowded.The room is on top of a busy highway that would not stop all night long.

hotel_103,hotel_5086,"Free Everything! This hotel is fantastic. I should stress that I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites before so I didn't know that they included so much in the base rate, but we were blown away. Among the things that this place provided for free were 'light dinner' (which could really suffice as dinner i.e. meatloaf, lasagne etc), alcoholic drinks every night we were there (Mon-Thurs), free hot breakfast, free in-room internet and a free shuttle to major sites. We were upgraded to a suite which was very roomy and had a great kitchen. It was a very nice room. The only negatives with the hotel were that the comforter/doona was scratchy (as a previous reviewer noted), and that the business centre broke and despite assurances of it will be fixed in two/three hours, it never was. Everything else about this hotel was excellent. The location is right near downtown - it's only a 5 minute walk (maximum) to the heart of downtown Seattle, and only 10 minutes or so to Pike Place Market. We walked basically everywhere, including to the Seattle Centre, the wharf to get the Bainbridge Island Ferry, and to Pioneer Square from this hotel. We only had to get a bus when we went to Fremont.I would definitely recommend the Homewood Suites Hilton for Seattle. What a great place!",9-Dec-08,0,0,6,6,5,6,5,5,5,4,$231

The rooms are incredibly large and for the price that we paid, we felt that we got a great bang for our buck!

hotel_103,hotel_1191,"Great value, comfortable hotel Pike Street Suites is a hotel of excellent value, conveniently located, spacious, with many comforts. My husband and I chose this hotel on a 3-day weekend for its location and low price (we paid $119 + tax on Expedia for a 1-br king suite). It had been recommended by my sister. The suite was large, very clean and true to the advertised floor plan. Contemporary furnishings, two plasma TVs, decent lighting, free wireless internet, and free local phone calls. We only used the refrigerator and microwave, but there was a full kitchen for meal preparation. The bed was very comfy, with crisp, quality linens, comfy pillows and excellent mattress. I particularly appreciated the blackout window shades. I did not hear any freeway or road noise from our courtyard-view room, and I am typically a light sleeper. We also enjoyed the medium sized private balcony, which overlooked cherry trees blossoming in the courtyard.The bathroom is average+. Marble counter and contemporary fixtures, but only an average sized tub and vanity area. Nothing terribly fancy, but perfectly clean. The workout room is small but has all the equipment I wanted. It was warm enough to enjoy the heated outdoor pool and jacuzzi, which were cozy but quite nice. There is also an indoor jacuzzi. The hotel is a short walk (uphill!) from the convention center and downtown shopping. Last fall, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, which is about 3 blocks away. While the Grand Hyatt is elegant and more luxurious, we had much more space at Pike Street Suites at about half to 1/3 the price. The lobby is still undergoing renovations, but we were not bothered by construction noise. Breakfast-in-a-bag was available, but we did not try it. A conversion to Homewood Suites is expected for later this spring. Hopefully, the hotel will retain its charms.",10-Mar-08,1,1,6,6,5,6,6,5,5,4,$231

hotel_103,hotel_3393,"Nice Renovations; Bed Type Issues Booked through Expedia, which guaranteed a King Bed. Because I'm wary of such promises when I didn't book direct with the hotel, I called the day of arrival to reconfirm a non-smoking King. The desk agent reconfirmed the bed type, so I felt confident about getting what we were promised.At check it, I saw that the Registration Card also stated Nonsmoking King, so I didn't reconfirm it with the desk clerk - I thought that would be overkill.We found our room - the halls are definitely taking some wear and tear from the renovations, but the room was beautiful - hardwood floors, well-appointed kitchenette, beautiful large bathroom, very comfortable modern sofa and a queen sized bed!We didn't notice the size of the bed until after we were completely unpacked (we were staying four nights), so didn't feel like re-packing and moving, so we didn't ask management to correct the situation. But it was mildly annoying to have taken so much effort, even on the day of arrival, and to have our promised bed type switched out from under us at check in.Otherwise, the stay was nice - good breakfast in the lobby each morning, with hot options in addition to cold. And it was very nice to have the kitchen - we were able to make hot tea and chocolate every afternoon after cold days in Seattle's December weather.We usually stay here because of the excellent location between downtown and first hill. We can generally walk anywhere, and we very much enjoy that.On the day of departure we called to see if the hotel shuttle was available to take us to the train station - I had asked the day before and was told they didn't take reservations and it was on a first come, first served basis. I was told that the van had just left in the opposite direction and wouldn't be back for at least 45 minutes, so we took a cab instead. After checking our luggage at the train station, we walked a block to a coffee shop and were passed on the street by the hotel shuttle!Having stayed here regularly for the last 8 years or so, I must say that the details have usually been handled better than during this stay. These little blips weren't enough to make me move to another hotel, but repeats of the same will definitely make me think about it, if I see similar issues in the future.",8-Jan-08,3,3,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,4,$231

The suites are newly renovated and you can tell as soon as you walk in, everything looks and smells new! My husband and I slept in the very spacious bedroom with a comfy King sized bed with all white bedding and fluffy duvet, similar to the Westin's Heavenly Beds. It had a flat screen TV on the dresser and nice modern furnishings. The 3 boys slept in the living area - 2 on the sleeper sofa and 1 on a roll-away and they still had plenty of space. They really liked watching movies on the large flat screen TV mounted to the wall. The suite also has a kitchen with everything you need to make a meal. The bathroom was large and very nice with a really cool sink and fancy tap. There was also a gas f/p which was really nice to have being Christmas so I was able to lay out the stockings by it like we do at home. I also brought a small xmas tree that sat nicely on top of a cabinet next to the f/p. It was lovely. The boys had alot of fun in the outdoor heated pool and I really enjoyed sitting in the outdoor hot tub sipping hot tea in the cool air. They also have an indoor hot tub and a fitness room which was sufficient for my husband and I to have a quick work out. The breakfast which is included was pretty good, the boys ate lots of their favorite Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal and waffles. They also have eggs and sausage, oatmeal, bagels, toast, fruit, yogurt, juice and coffee.The location can't be beat, close to restaurants (Cheesecake Factory just down the street), movie theatres, and shopping of course. There's lots of free parking around the area as well.Customer service was great helping us find restaurants that were open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and they were prompt with our request for towels and toiletries.The only negative thing was the outside of the hotel and small, unattractive lobby area, where it's very evident that there are renovations going on, although we never heard any noise.

This was my 3rd visit in the last year and I have been impressed each time. Our family was traveling to Seattle for a mini vacation and shopping trip and since we prefer to each have a little bit of our own space, I contacted the hotel directly to see what options we had. Based on their recommendations we reserved the Junior Suite adjoining the King Standard. The Junior Suite had a living room, kitchen and separate bedroom which adjoined a regular room with a king bed. This turned out to be a great idea and a wonderful deal. Lots of room and a small kitchen where we prepared dinner a couple of nights.Each morning we went to the complimentary breakfast off the lobby which had whole fruit, yogurt, pastries, cereal, juice, eggs, sausage and coffee. All fresh and breakfast room was bright and clean. We did miss the fresh waffles they used to serve though!The hotel is close enough to Pike Market, a number of shopping malls, movie theaters and restaurants that we only used our vehicle once during our stay. Easy walk to catch the Monorail to the Seattle Center (Space Needle, Sci-Fi Museum and others).Front Desk and Housekeeping were friendly and competent. I would like say thanks to Britt, Sara and Dan who were especially helpful.All in all, we had a great time in Seattle and were very pleased with the hotel.Highly recommended!",17-Dec-07,0,0,6,6,6,5,5,6,1,4,$231

(This is the day driver, not sure how the night driver is). I tipped him a minimum of 5 dollars for a short ride and he would perk up and be nice for about 5 seconds, the next ride would start all over with the pissed off attitude.

It is near the convention centre, downtown shopping and although it's called Pike Street Suites, the famous Pike Street Market was nowhere in sight.The lobby was worn and dated. The front desk staff were inconsistent - some friendly, some rude, none of them very classy, no uniforms, just a bit odd. The first room that we were given was sick! It reeked of smoke and had an ash tray on the tv, even though we'd asked for non-smoking. There was a de-humidifier blasting, it was tiny and the carpet was quite stained (think CSI miami before the cleaning crew).We went down and complained and she upgraded us to a suite. This room was amazing. Much cleaner, a big bathroom, seperate bedroom and living area. We had only paid $109 on hotwire, so I don't know what this type of room would normally go for - but it was very adequate. No view (well, back alley or highway) and mid construction - although it wasn't loud. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel because they tried to give us a sick room and if we hadn't complained our trip would have been lousy.

We were put in what was clearly a smoking room (based on the smell) despite having requested NS in advance and confirming it at check-in. The room was also poorly cleaned. We were preoccupied with our young children thus it took us 2 days to change rooms. Once we did, we were much happier. The housekeeping was still just OK, but the rooms are a nice size with a good layout. We generally are not very picky so it was disappointing to have our stay get off to a bad start. One person on the staff tried to tell us that the first room was NS but it was clearly on the one smoking floor (the 3rd). The breakfast was nice and the location convenient. The parking is valet only so tipping is involved but cars are delivered very quickly. There is a fair amount of street noise from traffic and pedestrians. If you're planning to walk places, note that the walk back from the Pike Place Market is a steep climb; however there is a free bus and the hotel has a shuttle.",11-May-07,5,5,4,5,5,3,3,5,4,4,$231

To paraphrase a note in the elevator, Hyatt is not in the picture, and Hilton will take over after a remodel that's supposed to be completed sometime this summer. It will then be part of their Homewood Suites chain.Their ownership situation has not affected this hotel negatively in the slightest. We found everyone at the front desk staff to be friendly and helpful. I requested a high floor and early check in and got both. I asked them for help in getting to the airport for a very early flight (we came in on Amtrak and flew back), and they arranged everything, and got me the best deal.We got a one room suite on the 8th floor, facing the courtyard. The room was very quiet, if you're nervous about road noise from I-5 (which really isn't that bad, IMO), then request the courtyard view. The property must have been apartments or condos at some point, the sound insulation was really pretty good.The room did show its age a bit, but wasn't bad. There was plenty of room, and the beds were comfortable. The kitchen had a fridge, stove, and microwave, and was stocked with plates, utensils, and glasses, which we did use a couple times.The continental breakfast in the morning is adequate, with the usual suspects available like fresh fruit, cereals, pastries, etc. Runs until 9:30am.The exercise room was decent, with 2 True treadmills, an elliptical machine, a recumbent stationary bike, and free weights. Also a TV, hot tub and heated pool.I did a lot of research before booking this hotel, and I believe it's the best deal downtown (we paid $130/night booking on the hotel website). It's two blocks to the convention center, and close to shopping. Also about a 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market, and less to some of the popular shopping areas like Pacific Place, Nordstrom's, Westlake Center, and the like. It's a few more minutes to the Pioneer Square area, but still not a bad walk. The hotel has a courtesy shuttle that can take you there if you ask.You can spend $100-$200 more per night to be a couple minutes closer to some of these things, you can decide if you think it's worth it, but we sure didn't. Maybe if you're on the company dime.Our only gripe has to do with the vagrant/homeless situation downtown. If you're from a bigger city, seeing these people around isn't a big surprise. But they seemed to be on about every other corner downtown and tend to be a bit more aggressive asking for money compared to some other cities. It's almost to the point where you hope the Walk sign is on when you cross intersections so you don't have to stop and be subjected to another in-your-face request for money. If you're okay giving change to them, more power to you. Otherwise just ignore them and they'll usually go away.",12-Jan-07,8,8,6,5,6,5,6,6,1,4,$231

The room was on the 8th floor facing the court yard which made for no noise but was interesting to see the other high rise residentials surrounding the courtyard, we could all look into each others windows, kind of disturbing and at the same time intriquing, I had to remind myself not to be rude and watch people eat or watch TV.The hotel is undergoing a name change and will be undergoing severe renovations which are much needed since it is in an upscale area, of course hwne they get done it will probably double the price of about $100 which I paid. scedule is to be done by summer of 2007.I would definately stay here again but probably spring for the suite rather than the standard room.

The good:Location, 10 blocks to Pike Place Market.Shuttle service that takes you to visitor locations.Close to shopping and lots of eating establishments.Huge rooms, we had a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen. A door that opened to small concrete patio.Great breafast buffet which included cheese omelets, sausage, make your own waffle, cereal, milk. fruit, juice, pastries, yogurt, oatmeal. Next door to the convention center.Comfy bed and clean bathroom.The bad:My reservation said we had a room with a jetted tub and when I inquired why we didn't have one they said they only had so many. It was the primary reason I chose this hotel over several others in downtown Seattle. Why have that as an option on the reservation if they can't deliver? I made the reservation two month prior at the hotel websiteWe also requested a quiet room. We were on the fourth floor facing Boren street. It is a hill so you are not really four floors above the traffic. The windows are not insulated and the traffic noise was horrible! If you are a sound sleeper or used to that type of thing it may not be a problem. Be sure to request a room that faces the inner courtyard where they have their outdoor pool. The rooms are showing some wear but I wouldn't put them in the shabby category yet. There was mold on the door track of the outside patio.",22-Sep-06,4,3,1,5,6,5,4,4,1,4,$231

Excellent free breakfast ... hot make-yourself waffles, good variety of fruit, variety of cereal, eggs, sausage, etc. Very available free van for trips downtown and nearby --- good deal for a tip of a few dollars. Parking is $20 per night --- figure it into your cost if you have a vehicle. Every time I have stayed here there was loud noise from the central air conditioning unit --- staff always came quickly to turn it off --- you seldom need AC in Seattle anyway.

hotel_103,hotel_3509,"Not a good move... From the time I booked my reservation (12/05) to the time I stayed at this hotel (4/20/06), it had changed ownership from Wyndham to Hyatt.I chose this particular hotel because I was going to a business conference at the WA Convention Center which is only a block away.I do like the fact that for a reasonable price, one can get a room with a kitchenette. I usually stayed at this hotel due to its location and the fact that Wyndham would ensure that I would get the room I asked for. Not so after the change to Hyatt. I specified in my reservation that I wanted a room away from elevators and vending machines. I also called the hotel directly a week beforehand specifying my request. The clerk advised me that they cannot guarrantee room placement under Hyatt but she would assign me a room just this once since I had made my reservation with a non-refundable payment in full under Wyndham. I also left work early to check in as soon as rooms were available so that I could get a quiet room to work. When I got to my room I found was next to the elevators on one side and the stairs on the other side. It was extremely noisy. I was told that there was no other room available, even though I had arrived 15 minutes before check in time. Everyone was polite and very sorry but that doesn't cut it when one hears stairway and elevator traffic all night and has to work the next day. It was very frustrating.In general, things were not as well attended to as they were when Wyndham ran things.For example, the light in my room did not work. Wyndham always makes sure that room fixtures do not fall into disrepair. The room coffee was tasteless.When I got to my roon around 4PM, there was a scattered array of breakfast dishes lining the hallway. In my years of staying at Wyndham hotels, they have not left dishes lying about the hall all day. Continental breakfast is the usual caloric cocktail of mini-muffins, microscopic danish and other combinations of air, starch, crystallline sugar and chemicals. Sadly, Seattle Summerfield Suites are sliding down the slope....in their new capacity of Hyatt Pull Toy.How disappointing that a once quiet, accommodating and well run-hotel is no more.",24-Apr-06,11,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,$231

hotel_103,hotel_5917,"Nice hotel and good location I stayed at the Summerfield Suites for 2 nights over the Easter long weekend, April 14-16. We made this reservation on hotwire. Check-in was quick. There was a business competition next door at the convention center so there were many high schoolers at the hotel walking around. We were given a room on the 8th floor, close to the elevator. When we opened the door, there was someone in the room so we walked back to the reception desk and asked for another room. The check-in clerk saw that he made a mistake so he gave us a suite on the 8th floor. The suite was big with a full kitchen, living room, a separate bedroom and full bathroom. A very good trade for the small inconvenience.Everything in the suite was clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. They now have toiletries with Hyatt on it. There is a workout room with hot tub and outdoor swimming pool on the 5th floor. They don't have a business center although they offer wireless internet in the rooms (so take your laptop). Every morning, they serve complimentary continental breakfast (includes bread, bagel, waffle, fresh fruit, cereal, juice, coffee). This was our first time to Seattle so we wanted to see everything. The location of the hotel is great. You can practically walk everywhere although you will be tired. Pike place market is 8 blocks down towards the water. The hotel offers a free shuttle in the downtown area which we used to drop us off at Pioneer square. We also found out that the buses in the downtown area are free and the last stop is 1 block from Summerfield Suites, right in front of the convention center. Parking - the hotel charges $20 for parking each night. We had a car but did not want to pay the fee so we parked on the street at night (free after 6pm and on Sundays). During the day, there is a parking lot on Pike, between 5th and 6th that offers $5 all day parking on the weekends. We paid a total of $5 for parking during our stay.On the second night, there were people who stayed a few doors down from our suite with dogs. You can hear them barking loudly until 11pm. After that, it stopped. If you have allergies to pets, you may want to confirm with the hotel that you get a room that have not have pets there before.All in all, we had a great stay at Summerfield suites and would stay here again the next time we are in Seattle.",18-Apr-06,5,5,6,6,1,6,1,5,1,4,$231 
hotel_103,hotel_5235,"Would stay at Summerfield again in a heartbeat I stayed here for one night by chance as I bid on a hotel through priceline. The location was perfect for me. You can walk a few minutes east and be in capitol hill or walk a few minutes west and be in the shopping district and eventually pike place market. So location is great. The room wasn't huge, but attractive and quiet. I had 2 full sized beds which would be crowded if you tried to fit 2 adults into each bed, but for me it was fine. The beds were very comfortable and didn't have gross  traditional hotel comfortors. The continental breakfast was great--hot and cold food, including waffle bar. Front desk staff was quiet and not very welcoming--the girl mumbled so much I had to ask her several times to repeat herself. But I figure I only have to deal with them for 3-4 minutes to check in and that doesn't really ruin the hotel experience. I used cabs so not sure about the parking costs or inconvenience.

hotel_103,hotel_4330,"Clean and comfortable suites Our family of four stayed at the Summerfield Suites in Seattle for 4 nights in March. At first I was a bit nervous about staying here because of the recent poor reviews, but our stay was great and we had a wonderful mini holiday. Apparently the Summerfield Suites had been taken over by the Hyatt Group as of March 2006. I had reserved it through Priceline and had a great deal. When we checked in, we were given a standard room with 2 double beds. The room was clean and had a mini refrigerator. At check in, I was told that if I wanted to upgrade to a one bedroom suite, it would cost an additional $40. We decided to try the standard room first. While it would have been just fine for 2 of us, it was a bit cramped with 2 young children. The next day when I inquired about upgrading, the cost was quoted as only an additional $20 so we took advantage of it. The clean one bedroom suite was very spacious with a huge king bed in the bedroom, a pull out sofa in the living room, a full kitchen and a very large bathroom. It was very very comfortable for our family. Although this unit overlooked Pike Street and the I-5, the traffic noise did not bother us at all. The hotel's shuttle service was great . . . taking us to Pike Place Market, Science Center etc. The complimentary continental breakfast buffet was huge with many many choices. The staff, on the whole, was very professional and friendly. The location is great too . . .easy walking distance to shops and restaurants.

hotel_103,hotel_9744,"Excellent as before We last stayed here in 2003, and I previously wrote a positive review. This time we had an even better experience, if that's possible. We once again booked through Priceline. We arrived for check-in around 11:15 PM. We had to wait for three other people to be checked in. When it was our turn, the clerk told us that he had automatically given us a late checkout of 2 PM so that we wouldn't have to rush in the morning. We were very happy for that, particularly getting it without asking. I didn't ask for any particular bedding arrangement, figuring we would just work with what we got. So imagine our delight to find we had two double beds in the bedroom, as well as the sofa hideabed (which didn't need to be used). The complimentary breakfast was pretty standard for a 2.5* hotel - I'd personally like less sugar and more whole-grain and protein options, but a reasonably healthy selection was available if you chose with care. As before, the suite had two TVs. I noticed that the TVs could not be raised to a very high volume. I remembered reading on another forum that some hotels had instituted this so that the noise would not disturb neighbors. That makes perfect sense, as with two TVs on in every suite at high volume, there could be quite a cacophony. I'm not one to be bothered by such things, but in my quest to be an objective reviewer, I did see a couple of chipped spots which would benefit from a spot of paint. All in all, this was a very nice, fully-equipped apartment, including full kitchen facilities.Note that as of January 5, 2006, Summerfield Suites is now a Hyatt brand, rather than Wyndham. The clerk explained to me that this was an improvement, because now you got free local calls and free Internet. I didn't use either, but I have to agree.",27-Mar-06,4,3,6,6,1,5,1,6,1,4,$231

hotel_103,hotel_6341,"Very Disappointing  I would like to describe what I can only describe as a thoroughly disappointing hotel experience. I made my reservations at this property months in advance based on several factors; Wyndham reputation, hotel location, services available (courtesy shuttle), and in room amenities. I was disappointed with all of these except the location. Upon check-in I was told the room I had reserved was not available. I had reserved a King suite and was given a suite with two double beds. I specifically reserved a King as I was traveling with an infant and knew that the extra space would be needed for the portable crib. I was told that the property was sold out, there was nothing they could do. Once I arrived at my room I was even more disappointed. The kitchen area was filthy. The dishes in the cupboard were dirty, the utensil drawers were full of mold and water, the bathroom had mold in the caulk, and my daughter (16 months old) found and was playing with an empty beer can in the back of a cabinet. I spent the next several hours cleaning a portion of the kitchen to my satisfaction so that I would feel comfortable preparing my daughters meals in it. One day during our stay my Mother, who was staying with me, had the courtesy van take her and my daughter to the space needle area. She was extremely happy with the service she received. However, when she was ready to return to the hotel and called the driver to come and pick her up she was told they would not pick her up as she was out of the courtesy pick up area - she was EXACTLY where they had dropped her off in the morning. After some discussion with the EXTREMELY rude person she spoke with a manager and was again told she was outside of the area. The manager then stated that the shuttle was in for an oil change - my Mother said that she would wait for the van to be finished and was told they would not come to get her. The attitude and behavior of the desk staff was awful! The only shining star was one member of the valet staff - Dan.I was extremely disappointed in this property and the attitudes of the staff members. The whole experience put a damper on both the business and pleasure portions of our stay.",23-May-05,5,5,4,3,1,2,1,2,1,4,$231 
hotel_103,hotel_2313,"A great place for a business person or extended stay Since 2001 have I traveled to Seattle 5-6 times per year and I usually stay at the Summerfield. I will be the first to admit that the place is not perfect. However, for my money its plusses far outweigh its minuses. For starters, the place was an apartment building before it was converted to a hotel. This means the vast majority of the rooms have reasonably good kitchens equipped with the standard appliances--with the exception of an oven. They do have microwave ovens, but as most cooks know: they are not the same. The one-bedroom suites have spacious bathrooms and cozy living rooms. There are TVs in the living area and in the bedroom. Many of the rooms have balconies, although there are no chairs out there. The mattresses are comfortable and the rooms on the south side of the hotel (the side that faces away from Pike St.) are surprisingly quiet, when you consider how close I-5 and busy Pike St. are. If you join the (free) Wyndham ByRequest program, your high speed Internet is free, and you can select from a free array of welcome snacks and beverages that will be delivered to your room. You can also specify what sort of pillow you prefer, whether you want extra towels  hangers, etc. In short, the hotel tries to make your stay a pleasant one. The hotel is very close to the Convention Center, and a little-known stairway just steps (downhill) from the hotel's front door takes you very quickly to the Convention Center's side door and from there on to Freeway Park. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there is a convenience store off the tiny lobby where you can buy food  drink you can take up to your room. The hotel has a complimentary breakfast in the breakfast room off the lobby. But better yet is the room service that is provided each evening by the excellent Tango Tapas restaurant about a block away. Also in the neighborhood, within easy walking distance, are Bambuza, for Vietnamese cuisine, and the Union Square Grill, an upscale chophouse. Parking is $20 per night, but this is $5/night less than the Sheraton just down the hill. If you don't have a car it is no great loss. That's because you are in downtown Seattle and there are plenty of places to walk to. Also the hotel offers a free shuttle van to drop you off and then pick you back up anywhere in the downtown core. Regarding prices, I find the best deals are on the Wyndham web site. I have stayed at the Summerfield for anywhere from $90 per night to $145 per night. Room prices seem to vary with convention center use. It is true that the hotel's public areas are getting shabby. Carpets need replacing, walls need repair, and the whole place could use a makeover. However, these minuses have not reached 'critical mass,' in my opinion. The Summerfield Suites is a great place to stay; I have already made reservations for my next trip to Seattle.",17-Apr-05,8,8,5,5,1,5,1,4,1,4,$231

It is more comfortable and familiar than up-to-date and trendy. A little like going to Grandma's house, with Victorian overtones, and the capacity to accommodate all your family and friends and be there for all your needs, including the warmth that goes with it.The breakfast that is available in the hotel is certainly adequate and right there when you need it. The location is great for doing a little roaming around in the historic and sports districts and the parking is very convenient and reasonably priced.

The rooms were nice, large, clean and inviting. Every night the staff came by and offered more towels, turned down your bed and put candy on the pillows. The location, in Pioneer Square, was fantastic. You walk up half a block and catch a free bus to anywhere, walk down a block to the waterfront and catch the ferry to one of the islands.

The room decor is very well done - down to the drapery, carpet and nice artwork on the walls. The bathrooms are modern and nicely sized. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms and bathrooms were spotless. The linens were fresh and spotless as well. The fresh fruit and free bottled water was a nice touch and very much appreciated. The breakfast room was clean and always stocked with the daily offerings. The coffee was good and the waffles were addicting. Even the elevator was fast and roomy. You don't realize how much you appreciate that until you go to another hotel where the elevators are sloooooow and tiny (as they were in our Victoria BC hotel). The Pioneer Square area is lively and exciting with lots of little shops and restaurants. We walked around the area at night and didn't feel unsafe. Other people mentioned street people as problematic. This is a fact of life in any large city, but none of the street people were aggressive or abusive. Just a block away, they offer a tour of Seattle Underground which was interesting. Pizza at Mario's was delicious. Dinner at Elliott's Oyster House at Pier 56 was wonderful. We found Seattle to be a great city with friendly people who are helpful and polite to tourists.

hotel_106,hotel_1977,"This is definitely not a ""Skid Row"" hotel!!! This is a very old and colorful area. Yesler Way where this hotel is location is on the original skid row. This was orginally a muddy road that logs were dragged (skidded) up to get to Yesler's mill. Thus, the term skid row was was given to this area. Loggers and millworkers being lonely at times liked to frequent the business that sprung up around this area. They also got a bit thirsty!!! I previously lived in Seattle for about 15 years. I rode or walked by the hotel several times and never gave it a thought. Was looking for a hotel close to the train station, by the bus stop, and close to the waterfront. You step out the door of the hotel and turn left walk about a block and your at the ferry terminal on the waterfront. You walk out the hotel door and practically next door is the bus stop for FREE bus service within the Downtown core. The Klondike Gold Rush museum is also in the area. They sometimes offer free walking tours that include a trip to the top of the Smith Tower (originally the tallest building on the West Coast). If you walk north up 1st Ave about 6-7 blocks  at the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) and the Pike Place Market. The rooms were small, but the hotel was built in the early 1900. The room was immaculate, and because of something we were given an upgrade to a deluxe room with city view. We got in about 9pm and walked to the waterfront. Ivars is open until late. We found a really good deal. They extend their Happy Hour on Fridays til closing. Well drinks, wine are $3.00. Limited menu but I got fried oysters for $4.95, can get Fish  chips also for 4.95 with view table looking out as the ferry terminal.

This hotel is the only one in Pioneer Square, and it is within walking distance of everything. In fact, it's across the street from the waterfront, which is a popular place to go walking and sightseeing. We never rented a car or taxi; didn't need one. Granted, we walked about 3-5 miles a day, but stopped anywhere we wanted along the way. You don't need a car in the city, and you have to call for taxis anyway...why not walk?The room was always clean, and a decent size for the two of us. It had a weird smell though, but it wasn't something we couldn't tolerate, though. It is very charming and cozy, and is within a few yards of great restaurants and bars. In fact, out of all the meals we ate, the restaurant next door, Al Boccalino's, was the best. They provide room service for the hotel, and they have some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Somewhat pricey, but it was SO good. Hotel staff were friendly, but not the most knowledgeable of all the questions I asked (such as, can they help with reservations for the Victoria Clipper, what bus # do we take to go to Ballard, etc.).

The large room was beautifully decorated with the king size bed taking pride of place. It looked so peaceful and welcoming with the period furniture and matching appointments that I couldn't wait to unpack and relax with a cup of tea. The lighting was excellent with not a 40 watt bulb evident. The towels were plentiful and fluffy and there was loads of room in the bathroom to lay out my toiletries. I thought the framed picture on the wall was a nice homey touch. The room was quiet and there was no noise to disturb a dreamless sleep that night. In fact, I was glad the next morning I had set my alarm the night before.I enjoyed my Continental breakfast the next morning of toast, jam, yoghurt, fruit and coffee. There was also cold cereals, Danish and muffins on offer. I learned that bus transportation is free in the Pioneer Square area and the bus stop is just steps away from the hotel entrance on Yesler. However, since I wanted to explore on foot it was an easy walk to the Uwajimaya shopping complex in Chinatown - a delightful place.

They would clean our room in the morning and again in the late afternoon with candy on the pillow. It is in such a historic area and right across the street from Pier, underground tour and waterfront walk. The area is in a positive transistion for such an older area of town. Lots to see and do and easy to catch the bus to other areas of town. Hotel is totally redone and refurbished with great service. If you don't care about having a room with a view, much cheaper rates.

I feel they have great rooms for the location/price but if you have a family beware they are DOUBLE beds not QUEEN beds. Parking is really only 1 block, if that. For a few nights in the historical district it is worth it. YES, most of the homeless seem to be in this area due to the missions. We need to send a response to the city about this. Otherwise, don't fault the hotel...they are great!!! The city needs to respond and do something w/ the homeless. The ENTIRE city has a probelm and I travel internationally a lot.

hotel_106,hotel_1612,"Just fine. This hotel is located in Pioneer Square, though just a quick walk to the water front/Pike's Market. However, the immediate location is a bit rough around the edges and there is a very apparent homeless population. Once you've walked several blocks away towards the market, it gets noticeably better. The hotel is very nice -- our room was spacious and nicely decorated. There was a very toxic cleaning agent odor that required us to open the windows and leave them open. Otherwise, it was a nice big room with a good sized bathroom. Breakfast was great. It is served in an adjoining breakfast room/cafe to the hotel and includes cereal, pastries, bagels and then some. Above and beyond most continental included breakfasts. The parking is about 1 1/2 blocks away and costs $18 a day. It's relatively convenient, though when we returned back to the lot around 9 or 10 PM after attending a wedding, it was sketchy. There were a few shady characters lingering around the garage (it's locked and requires access, but once your key card opens the door, anyone can cruise in after you.) All in all, it's a convenient decent place for a reasonable price. If you're looking for luxury, this isn't it, but it's more than adequate.",21-Mar-06,13,12,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,$173

Seattle, like SFO  NYC, has joined ranks of big city parking headaches so if you drive be prepared to hand over parking rates. Staff very gracious in allowing us to check-in early (12Noon) and were upfront about the $18/day parking deal up the street. We saw plenty of parking tickets under windshield wipers downtown  around Pike's so take it into consideration. Very centrally located; can walk to Pike's, restaurants on First, Pioneer Square boutiques  artisian storefronts, downtown shopping. Service was pretty darned friendly to say nothing of professional. As long as you know what you're in for with downtown Seattle parking (you pay, you pay, you pay) you'll be good to go. Clean, full of character, and breakfast was BW standard fare --not bad.

Excellent location, very nicely appointed rooms, and great continental breakfast. Kudos to Best Western for this fine hotel.Our biggest beef from our stay there was a front-desk person who was quite rude and unbecoming for a hospitality professional. His conduct was inappropriate and distasteful - when we walked in, he was slouching over the desk, and looked at my father and I as if we were unwelcome. He was then surly to us over a number of subjects. This got things off to a rotten start.

hotel_106,hotel_8628,"Great hotel  I had planned a two-night stay for early October in the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel after a train ride from LA to Seattle. After my first night (and seeing how much there was to do within walking distance), I added a third night.This is not your typical Best Western. It is in a beautiful c.1913 building. The hotel is modern inside with wireless internet access, while retaining the charm with huge doors, beautiful woodwork, and high ceilings. It was absolutely spotless, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Having read many reviews, I know to expect no free parking (not an issue as I didn't have a rental); and that the rooms could have been on the smallish side. Mine was certainly adequate, with a larger-than-average bathroom. My window was on an airshaft, but as I chose the lowest priced room, I expected that too. As I use a hotel room to sleep in, not view scenery from, I had no issue with it. I did hear someone complaining one morning about highway noise as their room was on that side, so I was glad to have my quiet brick wall!They offer a continental breakfast that is above average. There is a separate room off of the lobby with numerous tables, complimentary newspapers, and a staff of two to keep things clean  filled. Seattle is a very PC city, and yes, there are a lot of homeless found on the streets. But not one bothered me, and I had no concerns about walking to restaurants at night, alone. The streets are filled with people until quite late, as it is a very vibrant area. But it is not rowdy by any means. I would recommend this hotel to any of my family or friends. You are a block from the waterfront  ferries; Pike Place Market and the Monorail station are within easy walking distance. Taxis in Seattle are very reasonably priced and easy to find, and there is free city bus transport. Within a few blocks of the hotel, you have every kind of restaurant you could desire, many antique and art shops. If I ever return to Seattle, I know I will stay at the Pioneer Square Hotel.S.MurphyNH",10-Oct-05,21,17,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,$173 
hotel_106,hotel_3387,"What a Great Hotel! Don't understand the complaints on this website about this hotel. We stayed here for two nights in late August and loved everything about it. First, the location was great. It was within walking distance of both the waterfront and Pike Place Market, and we could easily take the monorail to the Space Needle. (There are hills in Seattle, so if you have someone with you who has trouble walking, you may want to consider taking a bus or taxi.) Both the lobby and the room were nicely decorated, and the staff was very helpful. Being on Pioneer Square meant that we could go next door or right across the street to get a drink and/or something to eat. Of course, we didn't walk through the square at night because of the street people who hung out there, but that's just common sense. We were never bothered by anyone, and because this hotel is so well located we were able to easily enjoy this great city. If you're worried about street noise, call the hotel directly and ask for an interior room. We had an interior king and it was very quiet. We plan to return to Seattle, and when we do, we'll stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square Hotel again.",6-Sep-05,22,17,6,5,1,6,1,6,1,4,$173 
hotel_106,hotel_7448,"The customer is NOT always right at the Pioneer Square It was a Sunday night in April, and we were in town for a concert, and after the evening crew gave a great effort, physically showing us a few of the different rooms (which were some of the smallest I've ever seen, with views of backend brick walls), they led us to believe when we asked about parking that we could either park on the street at no charge that night, or park in the garage a block up the road. When we were thinking about getting a parking pass to save hassle for later, they simply said, talk to the night shift when you get back and they will set you up. After coming back that night, a young man was working who claimed he was new, and got his manager when we asked about the parking. When we asked for the parking pass, he wanted $15 and we refused telling him we were led to believe by the conversation with the evening shift that it was free. The manager told us that that wasn't his policy as he pulled out his hotel policy book and that we either had to pay the $15 or park on the street which started on the meter at 7 am. This was great news coming at 1 am and exhausted. We felt cheated.  In an obvious bluff attempt he then proceeded to tell us that he would check the video tape (as he told us everything was recorded throughout the day) and if we weren't told about the charge he would give us our pass at no charge. When I accepted the offer staring him in the face, he then proceeded to go back on his offer and again refused to offer the pass running in circles, You mean they didn't give you the pass yet? Excuse me??? What? If I had the pass already, I would have been in a parking lot parking my car, and not in the middle of an argument about paying it. We had only been there checked in hours earlier and told the manager that we wanted our money back and would go find another hotel in that case. He refused. He would NOT refund us our money and we were forced to stay there that night. It was late, we were tired and he was running in circles with his lame arguments, we decided to wake up at 7 am, pay the meter for a couple more hours, and leave. I wasn't giving this place another dollar. The next day we found another hotel near the space needle and were treated with the utmost respect and in subsequent visits will never stay at that dive again. The only good thing, and the reason I gave a 2 and not a 1 was the one bellhop that showed us the small rooms and helped us with the door that would never swipe and really helped us out. The place is a nice location, but based on this experience, the lack of management skills, and others that I read that had the same parking problem, there are other hotels, and I would pass on the Pioneer Square Best Western.",20-Jul-05,31,17,3,3,1,3,1,3,1,4,$173

Also called the Pioneer Square Hotel, it's located just off of the square in downtown Seattle.

The rooms inside the hotel were of a decent size (not huge - but not tiny either) and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and along with the location, they were the highlight of the hotel.The only negative things I can think of is the fact that you do have to pay for your parking and that the complemetary continental breakfast was lacking in terms of selection and quality.Having said that - a clean hotel room at a good price in the heart of Seattle is a heck of a bargain.

This is completely not true. Parking is free in Seattle on the street between 6pm and 8am.They even put deceptive signage on the outside of the building facing the street, saying no parking between 10pm and 4am... but this is wrong. It is a public street, and falls under the same Seattle bylaws. Locals seem to know this and park there anyway to go to a nearby late-night club. Anyway, save your money and park on the street (plenty of free space in this area), or stay at the Travel Lodge next door which offers free parking.As for room...the organic fresh odor neutralizer stuff they use is nauseously overpowering. Any attempts by them to be eco-friendly were lost on us, as we had to blast the heat with the window wide open in order to try and aerate the room. Other than that, only minor complaints. It sucks that the room key is one big advertisement for some pizza company, and that there is advertising and overbearing signage in the room, but I guess this is to be expected for a major chain.",4-Jan-09,0,0,3,3,3,4,2,3,5,3.5,$172

hotel_107,hotel_7722,"Surprisingly decent I almost didnt book based on a couple of the reviews but I decided to chance it and I am glad I did. The hotel is a bit dated on the exterior and the neighborhood is undergoing a bit of much needed regentrification. I never felt unsafe but I can see why those unfamilar with the urban setting may be. While there were some street people about they arent aggressive and there are enough regular folk walking around that I wouldnt hesitate to put my 72 year old mother in the neighborhood.  The location is excellent! Read that again, Excellent. there are hundreds of restaurants all within about a 10-15 minute walk. I absolutely LOVE walking around in a vibrant downtoan urban setting and this area makes me want to trade in my suburban ranch for a loft. I tried the Spitfire on 4th and Bell and the Frontier room on 1st and Blanchard. Spitfire is southwest spicy sandwiches and salads and Frontier is excellent BBQ, not KC but very good smoked meats, ribs and sandwiches. The Space needle is around the corner, get an even numbered room for a view, otheriwise the view is just cityscape. The room was clean and while a bit bland served it purpose well. The bed was comfy and there was a fridge and micro. The bathroom is on the smallish side but the water pressure was great. The room is completely 'green' with low impact features which I would expect in Seattle.  The staff was very friendly, that famous northwest hospitality very evident. I would skip the restaurant in the lobby as it seems to be very basic hotel fare and since there are literally hundreds of great options so very close.  The hotel charges $15 a night for parking and while that is a huge pet peeve of mine I was aware of it going in and it only annoyed me to the point of mentioning it here. Really, tack on $20 to the price of the room and get rid of the charge, its silly.  With hotel prices rising rapidly in the past couple of years, this place gives a great experience at a reasonable rate. The place I stayed last year went from $140/night to $275, so at $130, this place is a steal and if you are expecting the W this aint it.

The manager suggested a grungy hotel down the road. They had cash, and our credit card and we even talked to the manager, but he told us he could not make any exceptions, as this would be discrimination. I think that it is discrimination to the teenagers, as they would not rent to them with our approval, written or verbal. I can make purchases online, but somehow I could not even place my credit card as security for the price of the room and other expenses. Some policies are too strict and some exceptions should always be allowed. I spoke to Best Western head office and they told me that all Best Westerns were individually owned and operated, therefore the policy was only with this one hotel.

Best decision I ever made!!My pros:- Everything is within walking distance (Space Needle is practically in your backyard, Belltown with all the restaurants, bars, and clubs is just a few blocks down the street and the Pike Place market is about a 10 minute walk away or you can hop on a bus to go deeper downtown, etc)- Rooms are clean.- Heater worked really well- They have room service, and their staff of servers are pretty considerate and nice- FREE wireless internet service and it's fast!- Room service called us to ask if we needed new towels or anything else.- My boyfriend bought fish at Pike's Market, which was delivered to this hotel. They were nice enough to store it in their restaurant freezer for us free of charge!Some cons:- You have to pay for parking- The hallways kind of scared me upon getting off the elevator because it seemed pretty dingy (they need to do some steam cleaning or something - I would not want to walk around on bare feet!)- The construction zone next to the hotel might worry people but seriously, we didn't hear any of that noise through the walls or anything in the morning.- The people at the front desk can be a little nicer but that really wasn't a big deal to us.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of its location.

I appreciated the refrigerator that functioned as a normal refrigerator, not an overpriced minibar, so I could keep my leftover dinner in there for lunch without worrying about getting stuck with a charge for opening the minibar.In general, the appointments were better than you'd get in a top hotel -- in a top hotel in Seattle you'd have a much smaller room, wireless would cost $20/night, and you still wouldn't get Comedy Central. Parking was expensive -- $15/night -- but you can park on the street for free with no problem. I had one major qualm with this motel, and that was that my non-smoking room was by no means truly smoke-free. You can't take a room that has been smoked in for 30 years, spray it with some sort of chemical that's supposed to neutralize the air, plop a no smoking sign down on the dresser, and call it a non-smoking room. After 5 minutes in the room, it was clear that it had been smoked in for years, and within an hour, my throat was raw and my eyes were burning from the residual smoke and chemicals. And I'm not all that sensitive to smoke, having grown up with a parent who was a smoker.

We had a striking view of the Space Needle right outside our window, which was pretty neat. If you're in Seattle to tour, they also have a huge selection of tourist brochures for various activities in their lobby, which is very handy.

Unfortunately we had a room at the rear, so our view was of buildings and a parking lot. Even # rooms had the Space Needle view.There was no hotel laundry which was suprising for a larger hotel.Hotel restaurant made mistakes with our menu  ordering - new guy I think - and numerous items were left off our tray with the room service breakfast.

hotel_107,hotel_2071,"Good Seattle Value I was pleasantly surprised by the BW Exec. Inn. No it isn't fancy. However, the rooms are clean, good-sized and the hotel staff is excellent. It is also a self-contained hotel with restaurant and bar, small business center and hot-tub and workout room. You really don't need more. It reminded me of 4-star hotels that I have stayed in in Europe. It's all there, if not up to the most modern standards.The rooms are a bit dated. They remind me of hotels in the 80s with the floral print spread and the honey oak furniture. Comfortable bed and those funky shampoo dispensers stuck to the shower wall. (They call it environmentally friendly)The halls were dark and low-ceilinged. They could use a good carpet cleaning and lightening up. They have started charging for parking, which is a real bummer. Free parking would make it THE deal downtown. Location is great for some things, particularly the Seattle Center area. There is, however, a disco across the street (a little loud on Saturday night) and power sub-station at one end of the building.Overall, not the Ritz, but perfectly acceptable.",31-Aug-07,0,0,6,5,5,5,6,5,5,3.5,$172

The lobby was very comfortable and they offer coffee in the morning and fruit and cookies during the day.The room was clean and it felt clean, if you know what I mean. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels. We didn't have a view of the space needle, we were on the other side and had a view of the hills, which was still plesant. They had a coffee maker with real coffee, a blow dryer, ironing board and cable TV. Local calls were free, which is very helpful when making reservations or just getting directions. I read in another review that the shuttle was a bust. But we had no problem with the shuttle, Actually it was a life saver. After walking all over seattle we really needed a ride. We called the shuttle and she was down and ready to go before we even got downstairs. The driver was great, we forgot something in our other hotel and she drove us over to pick it up. She nice and knowledgable of the area. We used the shuttle to drop us off at pike st. and called to be picked up at pioneer sq and she was there quick even durring rush hour. I highly recommend trying the shuttle.I did use the hottub and both times I went down it was empty and very peaceful. They also offer internet access on two computers in a somewhat private room, which was great to look up attraction pricing and hours. The location wasn't so bad overall. It was perfect for the space needle and all the attractions around it, it was only one parking lot away. It was a little farther away from the city center, but still a pleasant walking distance away. We had no issue on safety, we walked to a resturant in the Queen Anne neighborhood and back around 11pm and there were still familys, teenagers, and tourist of all kinds still out having fun.

Other than that, didn't see any other choices nearby nor any nightlife. Hotel offers a free shuttle service downtown but with long waits.

Pretty annoying.Environmental hotel: fluorescent lights, recycling bins, placards requesting you keep your sheets and towels for the duration of your stay (you can decline if you choose), soap/shampoo dispensers to save packaging.

I had a double queen room and it was clean and well-furnished with a fridge and microwave that came in handy. There was also free wireless access throughout the hotel--a big plus! A previous reviewer mentioned the room smelled and they did not have 24 hour room service--this was not true. I think that reviewer was confused--there is a Best Western Loyal Inn a few blocks over (and it did not look as appealing as the Best Western Executive Inn).

My only suggestions are that one not rely on the shuttle service. While they do their best to accommodate people, they can't always be available at the time people would like. It might be useful if they set up a reservation system so one would know whether or not the mini bus would be available when needed.

The room had a couch, chair  footstool, fridge, microwave, king size bed and a few touches that made it a little more luxurious than average. We had a great view of the Space Needle and we took the monorail down to Pike Place Market and walked around the waterfront and Pioneer Square. Glad we didn't have to drive in Seattle as that alone could have ruined our visit. This hotel was cheaper than one on the waterfront or right in the downtown business district and the monorail or the free zone for the bus make getting around easy. We actually like to walk so did that except for the mono back and forth from the Space Needle.

hotel_108,hotel_3294,"Grace Inn I attended a conference at the Best Western Grace Inn and Conference Center at Ahwatukee in Phonix last week. First, the good parts...The public areas at the hotel were really quite nice, and the conference rooms had the unique feature of opening on to the pool/patio area. With absolutely fabulous weather, we had those doors open all day and night, and it was such a nice departure from the usual, closed in, conference atmosphere. The pool area was quite nice and it looked like the restroom in the lobby had been recently remodeled.Now for the not so good...The rooms needed some updating BADLY. It was a sparcely furnished, huge room with a flat, planklike bed, a small sofa and a chair, a desk and a TV cabinet, and even with all of that in there, the place seemed cavernously empty. Old, OLD drapes and bedspread, and in that whole humongous room, one teeny little picture on the wall made it look uncomfortably spartan. The whole room slanted towards one wall, and one morning when I opened up my drapes a bit past the window, I found a huge crack in the wall. Seems like the whole place is on it's way to toppling!My friends had a room that slanted even more than mine... one of them had trouble staying on her bed without sliding out.Another friend had a shower head that was hanging off the wall.On arrival, the main elevators in the lobby weren't working and it took most of the next day for them to be fixed... so we had to use the freight elevator to get our stuff up to our rooms.The restaurant takes the prize for the world's worst breakfast buffet and service. One morning I sat there for 20 minutes and no one even came around for a drink order. No coffee... thank heavens I was able to scrounge some up at the conference.If you're attending a conference, there really isn't too much in the way of lodging close by... there's a hotel accross the highway, but it's a very busy highway, sort of like a freeway, actually, so it wouldn't really be convenient to stay elsewhere. There are, however, several restaurants within walking distance.

Most mornings the shower was cold. The hotel staff, although friendly and helpful, seemed in denial that we could possibly have problems with hot water. They did agree to turn it up and we finally had our hottest shower on the last day. For some reason housekeeping shorted us on towels and coffiee packets on occasion.We had a one-bedroom suite, which was very nice considering we were travelling with a 1-year old.

They advertise complimentary cribs when available, although they tried to tell me it was $10 a day when I called them directly to make the reservation. The sheet provided with the crib was not fitted, but was just a folded, full-size flat sheet. Fortunately, we brought our own fitted crib sheet which worked much better.The hotel advertises complimentary high-speed Internet, but that really meant free wifi in public areas of the hotel only, and some rooms had wired connections.

If they are having a meeting they block off half the room so seating can get scarce. A lot of people would take food back to their rooms. Social reception from 5-630p daily with wine, beer, soft drinks, popcorn and chips. The pool was in constant use during the day and some people were using the BBQ. There is a vending area with a couple of washer and dryers and pop/snack machines. The hotel is an acceptable drive to the airport but there are many closer if you need that. There is good pub grub at Gallagher鈥檚 down 16th and for Mexican at Ajo Al鈥檚 further south. Fresh and Easy market at 12th and Northern and a Safeway at 7th and Glendale. This hotel if perfectly fine and we will definitely stay here again as it much less expensive than the Pointe down the street.",7-Aug-08,0,0,5,5,4,4,3,4,4,3.5,$159 
hotel_109,hotel_9884,"Loved this hotel overall We loved this hotel. We stayed there the day we flew in and then the night before we flew out. It was close to the airport. The hotel staff was very friendly, the rooms were very clean, both times. The rooms were quiet. The pool was great and quiet both times, loved the lighted palm trees at night. The breakfast buffet was unbelievable, everything you could imagine and a wonderful lady taking care of it. The 2nd night we stayed there we had a king jacuzzi suite. Awesome suite, 2 bathrooms, sinks and showers seperated by french doors. Also 2 flat sceen tvs and lots of space in each room. The only complaint I had is that our suite smelled like smoke and it was a non smoking suite. We turned on both air conditioners to get rid of the smell and it wouldn't go away. I would highly recommend the hotel, great location, great service, good value.",3-May-08,0,0,5,5,6,6,5,5,1,3.5,$159 
hotel_109,hotel_9093,"Nice Pool, Old Hotel Stayed here in February 2008 for three nights. It was centrally located for the business and restaurants we frequented while attending a conference; however it was not as nice as the pictures lead you to believe. The Pool area is nice, but what hotel in Phoenix doesn't have a nice pool?All the doors for each room are on the outside, and that leads to high noise levels, especially since the hotel sits at a busy intersection. Our particular room sat right on the road, and it was noisy ALL NIGHT! The staff was nice, and allowed us to hang out in the breakfast eating area most of the night playing some no-money poker.

hotel_109,hotel_9914,"Two nights - $40 difference in price We stayed here two nights, at the beginning and end of our trip to Arizona. Despite booking the hotel on-line well in advance I got two different rates $116 for the first night, $152 for the second + tax. I'd say that the first rate is closer to the real value of the room - we debated looking for another less expensive hotel for the last night and canceling the second reservation but didn't want to go through the hassle, especially since we were traveling with a baby.What you get for your money - convenient location close to I51 but not close enough to hear the traffic. Easy 30 minute drive to the airport or car rental drop off. Good quality, clean rooms, comfortable beds, excellent breakfast (already described in detail in other reviews). Good area.We were upgraded on our first night to a two room suite (because they were overbooked) which came equipped with two washrooms (one wheelchair accessible), flat screen tvs, fold out couch bed. Very nicely done. Only complaint would be that the view was the stairwell heading up to the second floor and several mattresses that were being stored(?) there. On our second night we had a standard room with a single king bed - also very nice (but not worth the extra $40 we paid). We overlooked the pool and the jacuzzi was running all night. Front desk staff were very helpful and had good recommendations for restaurants -you're within walking distance (about 1 mile) from several restaurants - try Carlos O'Brien's.

The room had both refrigerator/microwave.Shower and bathtub were better than average.Continuing with the negatives: no morning newspaper at your door - in fact usually no newspaper on the premises in the late morning, at all. Breakfast room small and usually crowded with no pastries - had to settle for banana/yogurt. Coffeemaker in room was the one-cup-only variety rather than the usual (4-cup) pot. Location of hotel is intersection of two (Northern  16th Street) heavily traveled and noisy roads - ask for a room facing the back of the property. Request for a third bath towel daily was ignored.

Normally we stay at Hampton Inns but wanted to be in the Squaw Peak area and thus decided to stay here. Right from check-in we should have known what to expect. We arrived too early to check in but since we travel very often we knew it was possible to leave your baggage there until check-in. While initially the staff was rude, the gentleman FINALLY agreed to have us leave our luggage and said it would be in our rooms when we checked back in later. Of course it was NOT in the room and we were on the second floor and no elevator! We are in our 60s and this was NOT convenient for either my husband or me. Breakfast is boring with the same thing every day, not like Hampton Inns that vary the menu. The air conditioning did not function well, the water in the tub did not drain out so that when taking a shower you were up to your knees in water. When we arrived and I asked where one could go to check on e-mails, as had been advertised in their listing service available in the Business Center, they told me it was down and not expected to be up until Monday.........this was Sat. On Monday when I checked again I was told still not up until Tuesday. One couple standing at the desk when I asked that question and heard this, turned on their heal and left as this was a businessman who needed that service. VERY inconvenient. Still not up when we left on Wednesday. Maintenance is terrible......lot of evidence that the place has been let go. Breakfast area is very small..........as is the pool.......and with a tendency to cater to kids' traveling sports teams, you are lucky to find a spot to sit.

When I went to my room, I took the AAA Tour Book back to the desk and showed her where it specifically stated that the reservation could be upgraded if a suite was available and it would be free of charge.The same desk clerk started to yell again stating that she had told me when I called that I could upgrade for a charge and that was her rules. In fact I had spoken to a gentleman when I had called the week before, I never spoke to a lady. I asked her why she was raising her voice and if this was the way she spoke to guests.

hotel_109,hotel_4091,"Convenient and clean Have stayed in a wide range of hotels - 2 star to 5 star so generally I have my expectations managed. This BW was actually a little above expectations; part of that might have to do with the fact that we arrived fairly early to check in - around noon - and they had a room ready and upgraded us to a suite on the 7th floor. Now, it was a suite at a Best Western, but still nice to have the extra space. Convenient to downtown although with the light rail construction that's going on in and around the city, need to plan a little extra time. Plenty of extra parking although none of it is covered, so don't leave anything in your car if you're there over the summer or it will be cooked!

hotel_109,hotel_2832,"Traveling with a toddler Stayed at the Inn Suites beginning of May. We were looking for a budget hotel and I got an awesome deal on the Best Western site. (49.00 a night) Good points: room was clean and comfortable what you would expect. NOTE: We traveled with a 2 year old and there was NO room for a crib/ playpen with the two queen beds. This proved problematic as she was in/out of bed!!! Therefore keep this in mind before you order two queens! GOOD: Free breakfast in AM - You make waffles yummy, lots of juice, cereal, and other goodies. Unfortunately the breakfast room was small and often cramped, as well you may have to wait for your turn at the waffle cooker. GOOD: Staff where polite and offered travel tips. GOOD: First Wed of month they have a free BBQ (Hamburgers) looked OK but we skipped it. NOT SO GOOD: Pool was not the cleanest - scum around edge of pool. Hot tub either bath tub temp. or too hot? Also pool is located around the parking lot...therefore not the most relaxing, private or scenic. NOT SO GOOD: no place to sit outside room. There is a little deck, and pool area but we had to stay close to our room when our daughter was sleeping. We sat on cement railing and were in the way of cleaning staff.ADVICE: If you are traveling with kids, especially young ones - stay at a resort with LOTS OF AMENITIES! You do not want to be putting kids in/out of hot cars trying to find a place to eat or an activity to do. NOT RELAXING!ALSO: Avoid Tempe Town lake - not much there! Water park at Zoo fun choice! Lots of shade!AVOID AT ALL COSTS: Forgot the name but it is a Cowboy steakhouse in the hills of Phoenix.

The hotel was located about 2 short blocks from the entrance to the convention center, which was convenient. However, other than a few restaurants and the ballparks, there was not a whole lot within walking distance. But I think that is just downtown Phoenix.The good:My room was nice-- the beds were above average but not the super soft and fluffy ones you get in some hotels. I appreciated small adjustable reading lamps on both sides of both beds, and a cushioned window seat to look out at the view from. Free wired internet was nice, but it tended to come in and out, and was in fact down for about half a day while I was there. Bathrooms were nice and spacious with plenty of room to spread out toiletries and such. Slightly odd that there was a free standing closet in the sink area, but no matter. I at at the restaurant one night and it was surprisingly good for a hotel dinner. Starbucks in the lobby is closed on Sunday. Now the bad:Everyone was very nice and friendly when I checked in late at night. I got up to my room on the 16th floor, tired and ready for bed. Unfortunately, I noticed a small cockroach running around on the tile near the door. Yuck! I killed it, but called down and asked to change rooms-- this isn't my walk-up apartment in NYC after all. They were very gracious is changing my room quickly to another on the floor so I wouldn't have to come back down and added a credit for a drink at the bar to my account. Normally, I would just chalk this up to bad luck and not even mention it. However, on my last morning there in the new room, I saw and killed another one!

The room was average, nothing special. While it was clean and well appointed, it was pretty small. I stayed on the 14th floor and had no problems with elevator availability. Two things that stuck me as strange. The room had the smallest television I have ever seen in a hotel. Also, the light in the bath area was very dim. The ceiling in the bath was very short and being a tall person, this was a bit discomforting. The beds were adequate, nothing special. Plenty of towels, pillows, bath supplies. The bath area is very cramped. I couldn't see more than one person at a time using the sink area. I ate at Marston's for breakfast once. It was rather underwhelming. $14 for breakfast buffet was typical for a hotel restaurant, but the variety was lacking. I did eat at the conference in the meeting rooms. Fairly good, decent service.The bell desk and front door folks were very helpful. One thing about downtown Phoenix, if you expect nightlife or things to do during the day, lower your expectations.

The rooms were very large with nice beds, large couch space and terrific service. I stayed at the Wyndham during Super Bowl weekend and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. It's a shame that such a nice venue is located in such a horrendous area. It was my first ever trip to Phoenix and though I had heard that downtown Phoenix wasn't the most hip cities in the world, I was really unprepared for the ghost town that is the city of Phoenix. There is NOTHING around the hotel. It's like a movie set facade. On my trip to the airport I was half expecting to see folks tearing down the set to expose the empty desert. There are large buildings and convention centers but nobody spends any time at any of them Lest you think this was simply the result of the Super Bowl crowd forcing everyone to move to other locations, we spoke with several locals who confirmed that Phoenix is simply dead as a nightlife / restaurant city. I have no idea how those businesses down there can survive. And it's because of this lack of entertainment that I was a little unnerved by my stay at the Wyndham. I guess it's not the Wyndham's fault, necessarily, but while I don't need the area around my hotel to be Times Square or South Beach, I wouldn't mind a decent restaurant or two or maybe a bar. I was just surprised to find myself in a scene from 28 Days Later or I Am Legend.",11-Feb-08,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$260

Also, didn't honor my request for a king-sized room and weren't very nice about double-checking or explaining why they had done this. Booked through the NFL for the Super Bowl, and I was a bit surprised the league, which does everything first-class, would use a place like this. Yuck.",5-Feb-08,3,1,2,2,4,2,2,3,4,3.5,$260 
hotel_110,hotel_6329,"Lots of kinks We stayed at this hotel the night of the 31st. When we checked in, we walked into a room that looked like someone was still there- bed unmade, etc. The receptionist comped us and gave us a free upgrade, which we appreciated- the 2nd room we had to put in a request for the fire alarm to be fixed since it continually beeped. -We had cocktails at the lounge 1x that night. When we checked out, there was a bill for two visits to the bar. We felt like we had to defend ourselves. The staff checked through all receipts and finally found it w/ a very different signature / printed name than mine (thank goodness we had a the bar receipt when we actually ordered drinks so signatures could be compared). It had our room number on it w/ a totally bogus signature. No apology from front desk, nothing. We received a credit............This hotel has a lot of kinks to work out- would never return again!!!!

hotel_110,hotel_1397,"Very pleased-but a few minor quirks I stayed at this hotel for one night to attend a conference at the Hyatt next door. The Wyndham gave me a much better rate than the Hyatt, $159 for an upgraded junior suite on the 14th floor. The room and bathroom were very spacious, with an incredibly comfortable bed, high quality linens, and wonderful pillows. I asked for a quiet room, and it was that. I didn't hear a peek from neighboring rooms or corridors. The pool was pleasantly heated for an evening swim to unwind from traveling. I had perhaps the best night's sleep I've ever had in a hotel. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful. Chilled ice water awaited me on arrival in the room--a nice touch in Phoenix.A few minor quirks: the heater didn't work, although the a.c. did. I only noticed in the morning. I don't usually watch t.v. at hotels, but for those who do the t.v. was very small and old. The carpets are not upgraded, as was posted here before. None of these were a problem for me. My top priorities are quiet and comfort, with good service.",8-Dec-07,4,2,5,6,6,6,6,6,6,3.5,$260

It was almost funny - my room had the smallest TV I have ever hard in a hotel room. It was maybe 12 inches wide? TINY!On a positve note, the bathroom area is large with a seperate dressing and toilet area. The Wyndham amenities are nice (by Bath and Body Works).If I was in the are again, I'd probably try the Hyatt next door - I think it would be a real step up.",16-Nov-07,4,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$260

Our room was on the 9th floor and when I returned from the fitness ctr the entire 9th floor smelled of cigarettes. I asked at the front desk if the 9th floor is partially non-smoking and was told only the 5th and 10th floors are smoking. Obviously, ventilation is not the best.

When I arrived I was not given the room I had paid for (a non-smoking double bed room), instead I was given a Queen size bed, next to the pool and a gym. I attempted to go to sleep that evening, however there were people running up and down the halls, the person in the next room was throwing up throughout the night and people were partying by the pool. I tried to call the front desk several times however they did not answer. Around 5 A. M. I thought I was going to have some quiet, but people started running on the treadmill that was on the other side of the wall of our room. I complained to management and asked for a refund but was told they could not refund me my money, I would have to take it up with hotels.com. I spoke with hotels.com who called the Wyndham, they were told that no such thing took place and if that was the case security would have taken care of it. Romey at Wyndham even went as far as to say that no one else complained. I know this is not true becuase there were many people at the front desk complaining including pilots and flight attendants, who were very upset because they had to fly a plane on no sleep. I called Romey at Wyndham and asked her why she would tell hotels.com something that was untrue. I explained to her that I and many others had spoken with Andria the day manger and she was fully aware of all the problems that occurred throughout the night.Romey was very rude and said to me 'What is it that you want? Why are you calling us? I explained that I was not satisfied with my stay and would like a refund. Romey informed me that she was not authorized to do that and I should not have gone through hotels.com.

Food was OK, guest room ampious, although without a mini bar. Lobby, lounge and bar small but well decorated. Also, the location of the hotel was in downtown (Copper Sqouare), with many restaurants nearby.

I was very disappointed! The rooms are in major need of an overhaul! I talked with many other coworkers also staying at the hotel who said the same thing about their rooms. The carpet in my room was worn and stained, and the room did not have enough lamps for adequate lighting. My wall-unit hairdryer was no longer hanging and I had to get the entire unit out of the closet each day. The bathrooms are tiny and mine was unclean. Every morning at breakfast people were complaining that there was no hot water. I took a cold shower two days and lukewarm the others. In addition, the remote on my tv did not work. On a positive note, the lobby was fairly nice and attractive. Unfortunately, the elevators often had long lines and it would take quite some time to get up or downstairs.The location of the hotel is good if you want to be downtown.

Our King petite suite was very roomy and the view was nice - we were on the 11th floor, but it was very dated and the carpet was worn and dirty. Service at the front desk was quick but not very friendly and service in the lobby bar was non-existent unless you walked up to the actual bar and that was crowded and busy.

The staff were friendly and more than happy to attend to the details. Before I arrived I joined the free Wyndham ByRequest club after seeing the benefits listed on the hotel website. It was nice to have a complimentary snack and drink waiting for me when I arrived. The hotel was very central to the convention center only about 2 blocks away, there were lots of places to eat around the hotel as well in all price ranges. If the hotel was just about the room and the quality of that I would have been very happy. However, the elevators really let the hotel down. For the entire 7 days that I stayed there were problems, on 1 occasion it took me 15 minutes to come down from the 17th floor to the loby, I could have walked so much faster than that if it was an option! By the time the elevators did arrive they stopped at every floor making for a very tedious journey. There were even orderly lines formed in the lobby of people waiting to go back to their rooms. I can understand mechanical failures happening and I can put up with that for a short time but not for the entire time.

The room was clean, comfortable and secure. We did not use room service nor did we eat in the hotel restaurant. We did not use the fitness center either (not our idea of a vacation). The pool was closed, but guests were given passes to use the Hyatt pool right next door. For what the hotel had control over, there wasn't much to complain about unless you are expecting some kind of 5-star luxury treatment (it's a Wyndham, not the Ritz). If you need to stay downtown, I would recommend this hotel if you get a decent rate.Things around the hotel you should know: They roll the sidewalks up in downtown Phoenix around 3:00 except for just a few local watering holes and restaurants. Construction is everywhere too. I would only stay downtown if you need to. Outside of town is much nicer and parking is usually free. Scottsdale is the happening part of town. If you do stay at the Wyndham and/or downtown, avoid the Subway sandwich shop across the street (it is horrible).

Our vacation was actually set up to go on tours, not to stay in the downtown area which yes, it is VERY DEAD and small. We walked around on 3 seperate nights and all we spoke about was where are the bars and clubs and the people???..if you are looking to party..go elsewhere..I'm not sure if Arizona is even a party place so just cancel your plans. If you are looking to go to the Grand Canyon and do other tours...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED..they work with Open Road Tours and if you book through the hotel, rates are cheaper. We did 4 different tours and they were all great..Arizona is beautiful...honestly, we had no idea how great it was. We felt confident that our tours were going to be worth every penny being that the Wyndham recommends them. Now, the room.....smaller than expected but it was amazingly comfortable.

Although the interior is security gated, I really did not know if my car was going to be there in the morning. The noise from the surrounding rooms was horrible.

I realize the hotel cannot do anything about the police helicopter noise while they were searching by spotlight for somebody in our parking lot area, but it sure added to the total ambience of the place. The rooms were clean but worn down looking, the bathroom was exceptionally dinky. The one good thing I can say about this hotel was the front desk staff is especially helpful and nice.

hotel_111,hotel_4604,"OK but needs renovation I was looking forward to my first stay in an Embassy Suites facility. I was part of a convention contingent who had been booked into the hotel. The neighborhood is not good and if you do not have a car, you are captive to the hotel without other attractions, dining, etc within safe walking distance. The hotel seems to be about 5 miles from all attractions (down town, Scottsdale, etc) except the airport, which is very close by.The lobby was nice and comfortable and the front desk staff was pleasant. While my room was ready, others in my party waited hours for a room (and we arrived at about 3:30 PM).The official hotel photos looked nice, but the room photos they showed must have been somewhere else in the facility. The photos published by other reviewers were like my room. We had requested a double-double room for three adults. We had two beds, but they were small double beds, not the queens appearing in official photos and implied we would get. I ended up sleeping on the sleeper sofa so my wife and son could rest on a real bed. The sleeper sofa was like sleeping in a hammock without the comfort. It sagged terribly and the framework pressed very firmly across my chest a hips. It was a very uncomfrtable 7 nights. In addition, I discovered the bedding had not been changed prior to my use -- I ended up with insect bites all over my torso that I had initially attributed to a reaction to a laundry detergent.Room service arrived at our room around 5 PM every day except one while we were there. None of the maids spoke English. We had to call housekeeping to find someone who spoke English and ask that the bedding be changed on the sleeper sofa. Otherwise, the ladies did a good job when they finally got there.As written elsewhere, the rooms are severely in need of renovation (which is actually underway). The bathroom (tub and toilet) is very small. You almost have to climb over the toilet to get to the tub. Opening the door while you are in the bathroom is an adventure since the toilet does not allow much free space to move about. The sink is in the bedroom. It appears as the newly renovated rooms will have a more functional bathroom. Supplies were adequate. There is an iron and ironing board in the room, There is a hair dryer by the sink.Air conditioning was adequate, but ran nearly constantly and was a bit noisy. The small kitchen had a very high counter, but included a nice refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker.The TV was in need of replacement. Viewing selctions (the free ones) were pretty limited. There is a TV in the bedroom.Internet access was available either through an ethernet cable (located by the couch) or wireless. There is a $9.95 charge per 24 hours for use of the Internet (it amazes me that far less expensive properties offer this for free). The wireless connection dropped-off at times, making on-line work difficult at times.The pool was very nice. landscaping in the courtyard was enjoyable. There was a Gazebo with misters for outdoor functions.The on-site Agave Grill offered a wonderful free cooked-to-order breakfast every morning. Lunch selections were decent though a bit more expensive than I would like to spend. Dinner selections were expensive and mostly of a Southwest cuisine. You can order off the lunch menu. Other than breakfast, food taste and attractiveness was only fair. Every dinner plate I received was chipped (maybe I kept getting the same plate). The facility offers a Manager's Happy Hour with free soda / pop and reduced price alcohol. There is also free finger food / snacks.There are laundry machines on-site, but be sure you have a supply of quarters -- they have none at the front desk and the bar only has a few.There is a new CVS Pharmacy across the street as well as Mexican grocery store -- otherwise, you need to walk some distance to find anything else...and this is not the best neighborhood. Taxis don't work this area...and if you catch a cab down town, have the hotel address in hand since most cab drivers do not seem to know where this place is located. i could not figure out the Metro bus system, but doubt I would have used it anyway in this area.

hotel_111,hotel_4003,"Mediocre by expected standards, and in the midst of a renovation I stayed at this facility while attending The American Legion's National Convention; this was the property to which our delegation was assigned. In terms of what I would expect from the Embassy Suites brand, this was mediocre to disappointing. The property itself is in a marginal/transitional part of the city, and is not particularly convenient to many of the major attractions in the Phoenix area. A traveler staying here would definitely need a car to get around. It is an older facility, though would have much promise with a major upgrade. The rooms are relatively spacious, but a bit spartan and worn. The entry doors were marginally secure. The walls were thin, so any external noise from outside or in adjacent rooms were sometimes quite audible. Some of the electrical outlets worked part of the time, or not at all. The air conditioning was spotty at times. The in-room refrigerator was slow in chilling stored beverages or food items. The bathroom is incredibly small; you very nearly had to step over the toilet to get into the shower/bathtub. The beds were small and rock-hard, which - combined with the spotty air conditioning - could make restful sleep problematic. The televisions were old and in poor working order, and the cable system was even worse, as several featured channels were nothing but snow depending on the time of day, or even the room you were watching in.General cleanliness of the facilities was so-so. Housekeeping was open to the outside, and cleaned bath towels were stacked near the entry, which almost made laundry pointless. Laundry facilities were also outside; while the washer and dryer units were relatively clean, there was no place to fold or stack. Additionally, quarters were virtually a precious commodity in the hotel, and $1.00 only bought you 20 minutes of drying time. Housekeeping services were ridiculously slow and late-arriving. It was not uncommon during the week's stay that your room would be left unserviced until as late as 4:30pm. On average, housekeeping would not arrive until about 3:30pm. My two or three experiences with the front desk staff were generally poor; they did not seem knowledgable about their own property or the area, and could not meet my requests (see above with obtaining quarters for laundry).The saving grace to this property was the Agave Cafe, their on-site restaurant and bar. The staff was very polite, friendly, and responsive - even in busier periods - and the food selection was very good and generous in portion size. Lunch and dinner prices were as to be expected for hotels. Again, this property was not what I expected from what I knew fo the Embassy Suites brand. This property was undergoing a renovation during my stay, which appeared to include a complete rebuild of the guest suites. If they do an extensive renovation, there is some promise to the property, but they will have much work ahead of them to make it a place I could recommend to other travelers.",31-Aug-08,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,$185 
hotel_111,hotel_2742,"Tired Property In fairness, the property appears to be in the middle of some work so perhaps a year from now would be better but I was there August 2008...The property is worn, shabby and certainly not up to the standard of other Embassy Suites at which I have stayed. The front desk was very pleasant and check in no problem but the room was clearly in need of a renovation. All rooms are exterior corridor opening to their courtyard. The interior wall adjacent to the corridor is painted brick and doesnt give a great feel rather it feels like a cheap attempt to hide odd construction. The furnishings were old, wallpaper worn, bathroom needed cleaning and sprucing up etc etc. The location is not, I am now advised, in a very secure part of town.The internet connection ($9.95 per day) is via a ethernet cable which never worked during my two night stay. Luckily, the business center in the lobby was open and working.The hotel has a restaurant on its fifth floor which served decent food.Overall, I was disappointed with the quality of the room and would not return to this property.",27-Aug-08,0,0,1,2,2,3,5,5,3,3,$185 
hotel_111,hotel_2476,"Wonderful stay My husband and I booked this hotel when we flew to Phoenix last week to move our daughter there. We flew in early in the morning and by the time we checked in later in the afternoon we knew that our daughter would have to stay the night with us because she couldn鈥檛 move into her apartment until the next day or day after that. I told the woman at the front desk and thought I鈥檇 have to spend more for my daughter but to my surprise, she gave us a lower rate than the one I鈥檇 booked which was $75 per night [I understand that July/August are the off season months for Phoenix, thus the lower rate]. I agree with a few of the reviewers that the rooms could be updated some, but ours was very comfortable for the 3 nights we were there and we loved the accessibility of the airport. The lobby is very nice and the business center was easily accessible and met our needs. Our breakfast each morning was wonderful, one of the best Embassy Suites breakfasts that I鈥檝e had. My one major complaint was that they charged $9.95 for Internet access in the rooms for a 24-hour period. This is the first instance of paying for the Internet that I鈥檝e encountered in any of the Hilton properties. I was the only one of the 3 of us who used the pool and it was very clean and actually refreshing despite the fact that the temps were well into the 100s each of the 3 days. All in all, I鈥檇 recommend this hotel to everyone.

You judge for yourself. THE BAD:1)If you don't call early they only give a very limited number of late checkouts and it is only 1 hour more than the regular check out time. 2)The hotel pool closed at 8pm due to cleaning. Which was an inconvenience with kids. It was stated no where on the website. Nor when I called the hotel THAT DAY did they mention that. The jacuzzi was nasty and then it was closed the morning of second day we were there. Plus the pool was NOT heated so it was very very cold even during 80 degrgee weather.3) There wansn't anyone patrolling by the pool even though it was right by the front desk, so people were rough housing and throwing ice into the pool. Dumping people into the pool. Ridiculous.4)Apparently if the weather is between 55-70 degrees they will not run the air conditioning. Needless to say it was tooooo HOT for me to sleep at night! Horrible! During the day the air conditioning was not on either and it was in the 80's!5)People were loitering the hall and just hanging outside by their hotel rooms and management did not do anything about it. We had small kids and they were cussing and yelling (even though they had children too).6) The restaurant on site - was ridiculously priced. A Grilled Salmon wtih veggies was $21.95. Steaks were $24.95. there is a lunch menu with sandwiches but they will not give it to you unless you ask for it during dinner!THE GOOD: 1)Free Cook to Order Breakfast2) Free shuttle to and from the airport 3) Friendly front desk staff**Needless to say I would not stay here again just because of the air conditioning situation.",27-May-08,0,0,3,4,5,4,4,4,1,3,$185

We had problems with both the TV and the internet service. The air conditioner ran the entire time we were there, and was barely doing the job. It was only in the mid 80's, so I can imagine it would be insufficient if it would have been really hot. The bathroom was tiny, to the point where you had to back up to the tub to even shut the door. The sink area is in the bedroom, so it is impossible for one to sleep if the other one has to get up. The blackout curtains were nice, and actually worked. The linens needed updating.

I was very impressed with the big roomy rooms. I've never stayed in an Embassy Suites before, so I don't know if they are all like this, but it had a front room with a bedroom in the back, a nice desk and TV out front and a separate TV and table in the bedroom. It just seemed very classy and like the kind of place you could actually bear staying at for several days of business or fun. I liked the big central courtyard with the pool (though I didn't use the pool) and the 24 hour snack shop near the front desk was useful... :) Perhaps the very best part was the awesome custom cooked free breakfast in the dining room. The chef there takes your order and cooks eggs/pancakes/sausage/ etc to your liking and then you add fruit etc and your off to a great start for the day...Problems: (just a couple)1) The line at breakfast was always just a bit too long2) They charged extra for internet access ($10/day).

hotel_111,hotel_8380,"Hot ,noisy, dirty but food is good According the hotel, in the fall season the air conditioning has to be turned off to be ready for winter. Unfortunately the conference participants staying in the hotel were not informed of this fact. The weather was in the 80's during the day and our room was 85+ at night. A few fans were given out but the only window in our suite faced the busy street on the ground floor and had no screen. We requested a room change but were told none were available. Repeated complaints to the front desk resulted in several free meals at the restaurant- which actually was very good and, oddly, airconditioned unlike the rooms. Nothing was done about the room temperature or the screens or the fan which fell out of the open window.A month after our stay there was an expose on Good Morning America of the cleaning practices at this hotel.

We used the service from airport to hotel and from the hotel to the Heart Hospital where my father was being treated. They always arrived with in 20 min. and were pleasant.I cannot recommend any of the Indian Casino's. The drinks were 5 dollars and alittle warm. The slots were exspensive. No penny slots. Everything nickels and quarters (I take that back, there were 5 machines that were 2 cent). Most of the ticket machines were non-functional and you had to go to the cashier and wait in line.Sorry, back to the hotel. The Embassy Suites had a great cooked to order breakfast.

I was given a free dinner coupon for my troubles, but the restaurant was not very good either.The hotel is old and should be sold or rebuilt. I asked for a quiet room, especially since loud construction was going on in the courtyard and placed in a room next to a busy street that was very loud. Especially with the cracks in the sliding glass window to the street. After trying to nap before a meeting, I gave up and asked to move. The desk person informed me that all the king rooms were on that busy side and placed me in a double bed room that was quiet. Why didn't the first person at the desk tell me that when I explained being sick and requested a quiet room?When I tried to use the internet service, the instructions given to me from the front desk were wrong.

First of all We booked this room because it was about twenty dollars cheaper than the other hotels in the chain. I was a little nervous, but I had never stayed at a bad embassy. The web site doesn't mention this but 80% of the rooms are outside with front and back entrances leading to the outside. On this particular day it was 110 degrees in Phoenix. When we arrived we were hot. We had driven for two twelve hour days in the sun, and just wanted to relax. We checked in, front desk staff courteous. Gave us our room key and we went on our way. First thing we noticed upon walking in the room was the smell. It was very musty and the room was a COMFORTABLE 87 degrees. The air was completely off. So we turned it down and waited for it to cool off. Not so lucky. After two hours the room was only down to 77 degrees and it wasn't going any lower. I am on medication and am supposed to watch my heat exposure and I was already way too hot. Then I saw a sign that said you have to pay for internet and local calls. Also not on their website. Called the front desk to complain...then went to the front desk to inform them about the air. They said they would send maintenance and I was a gold member so the internet was free. 30 more minutes pass. I make another call. Oh they haven't been there yet? He probably doesn't have his radio. I'll look for him. Can I speak to a manager? Oh there's not one on the property. As I am standing over a letter that says if you don't rate us a ten call the manager on duty. We will find someone and give you a call. Ok...twenty more minutes pass now I am calling the 1-800 hilton number. Oh and by the way the internet is down. Or isn't strong enough to reach your room. Temperature is still 76 degrees. Finally an hour after the first call maintenance shows up. Meanwhile hilton honors is trying to get me in another hotel. When hilton finally reaches the manager she says if they leave they still have to pay. By the way this was also after asking to switch rooms. We were told there were no other available rooms. Finally three hours after checking in we were released to go somewhere else. We ended up in a beautiful hotel, for twenty more dollars a night. I do not believe our problem would have been resolved so QUICKLY if we had not been Hilton honors gold members. By the way maintenance took the cover off the air conditioner, took it apart and put it back together again and said it was fixed. Temperature upon checking out 76 degrees.

I have stayed in many airport hotels but will never stay here again. We arrived late in the evening and signed up for an early morning shuttle to the airport. The pool was about 100 degrees and offered no respite from the 115 degree heat. The rooms are definately dated and the location is in a less than optimal neighborhood. The breakfast wasn't bad, but I've had better at other Embassy Suites. When I returned one week later at 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon I called for a pickup. I was told that no shuttle was available so I should to take a cab to the hotel and they would reimburse the driver $16. When the cab driver asked to be paid, they refused to pay him and I was stuck with the bill! They said they had no record of my stay, so I asked the manager, Tamara Carter, if she wanted to see my receipt. She did, so I dug through my luggage and produced a receipt for my $142 stay. She then said that I had neglected to sign in when I arrived the week before, so she couldn't reimburse me for the cab ride. She pointed out that if I had parked at the airport, it would have cost me a lot more than $16. I pointed out that I wouldn't have stayed at their hotel had I known they were going to charge me for the transportation. This hotel administration is obviously trying to cut expenses by not paying for a shuttle and sticking it to the hotel guests.

The kitchenette also has a microwave, mini refrigerator, bar sink, coffee maker and four sets of coffee mugs and glasses. The two room suite has a work desk with telephone and task chair, sofa sleeper (we did not use this), chair, and TV. The second room with the bed has a bureau that doubles as a TV cabinet and clothing storage with ironing board.Staff at the hotel, from the front desk, management, restaurant personnel, and maid service were outstanding.

That request was granted however still on the 2nd floor. However, the room was wonderful. I had no complaints about the room or the service at all.

The hotel was completely booked the entire time that our party but you would have never known it. The pool was relaxing and well maintained. They would even leave the pool open later then normal since most of the guests were in meetings and dinner parties so when we got back to relax it was nice that we could have some pool time.

The room was kept clean and like I said before there were no complaints. However if you are wanting to walk at all around the outside of the hotel area I wouldnt recommend it, as well at the staff not recommending it. Its not a great area of Phx to be out alone walking, even in the daytime as far as I was concerned. However I did it one time in the daytime but was scared. You can hear other guests shower and toilet going when they were being used so that was noisey. But that's in most hotels I guess.

They were very spacious and the bed was comfortable. While this hotel is not really near anything except for the airport, I didn't mind since my meeting was at the hotel.

Breakfast was good, the pool very appealing, and the complimentary Happy Hour jovial. Service was cheerful and friendly - both room service and restaurant. The location is quite central in far-flung Phoenix, and handy to the airport and freeways. There's a good grocery store a couple of blocks away, and the hotel provides barbecues and dishes if you want to dine in.

So we drove about ten minutes to this Embassy suites for the 4th of July weekend and had a blast. The hotel has a very large circular pool that very comfortably accomodated all of its guests over that busy holiday weekend. My kids loved it! The room was clean and comfortable. Not quite as shiny and new looking as you would expect Embassy Suites to be, but it was okay. The best part is the cook to order breakfast. What a money saver, especially when traveling with the family, and the food was delicious. They will make you an omelet with your choice of ingredients. They also have all the potatoes, sausage, fruit, danishes or just scrambled eggs that you can eat. Plus they have a variety of fruit juices and coffee. It was great!

hotel_112,hotel_3515,"The Good and the Bad I recently stayed at this hotel for a convention. The front desk staff were VERY courteous. Ruth put a rush on my room's readiness with housekeeping and it was ready within 30 minutes. The room was a fine but there were stains on the carpet. The floor was uneven as it inclined at the front door, which caused me to trip a couple of times, which is not good for someone with low vision. The carpet was not marked to reflect this unevenness. The walkways around the rooms were also uneven and often difficult to navigate for someone with low vision. When I tried to take a nap, I saw a 1/2 inch long white bug crawling in my bed. Other convention attendees had other kinds of bugs but were told they would go away by staff. On the last day, we ran out of toilet paper. On the good side, the staff I dealt with was VERY nice and helpful. Giovanni in the restaurant went out of his way to serve us well. The food, especially the breakfast, was excellent. The meeting facilities were top notch and the serving staff and bartenders were competent and obliging.

hotel_112,hotel_9536,"Needs an overhaul We stayed at this hotel for a conference and were underwhelmed by our room. It had two TVs, both of which were fuzzy and had remotes that barely worked (some buttons were simply dead). The tub was so small that I fear even a 5 year old would overflow it trying to bathe. Four out of five pillows were hard and old, the drawers on both bedside tables would spontaneously open and the doors to the main closet fell off. The main lobby is quite nice, and the restaurant, Lafitte's, was delicious and well-priced. The pool is nice, but there were no umbrellas on any of the tables which I found weird considering the scorching 100 degree sun. Basically this is a once-amazing hotel that has aged and gone into disrepair a bit. If they were to reno the rooms, and upgrade, they could return to prominence as a choice hotel. Until they do overhaul though, I would recommend against a stay there.",29-Sep-08,0,0,3,2,4,3,4,5,4,3,$202

Our room faced the pool which was nice but rather noisy at night.Our room was clean but very dated. The furniture was old and the sofa was very uncomfortable to sit on. The location was nice and close to many restaurants. We found the front desk staff very accomodating and friendly. I can't say much for the Happy Hour though. The hot snacks consisted of melted Cheez Whiz and some tiny egg rolls and chips and salsa. Not worth the walk to the lobby.

There were so many things wrong this time, that it really soured our desire to return. The rooms are definitely dated, and worn out, and not worth the $200/night cost. Breakfast  cocktails are nice extras, but not worth the price!The room... mildew in the shower, gray line along the carpet edges (they don't know how to clean the edges of a room!). The message light on the old room phone was flashing  engineering couldn't figure out how to fix it, so I unplugged it. The walkways outside the rooms were covered with trash... daily, we saw bandaid wrappers, cigarette butts, in piles  rubbed down to their filters, and even a used qtip. gross! As for the non-functioning business center... not one day did the printer work. The room was a mess, no printer paper, messes left behind, and computers would freeze when you used them!Our first night there, someone spilled a sticky drink in the elevator... the mess was still there 3 days later when we checked out.

Breakfast every morning is fresh, and omelets are wonderful. Only small problem is the wait if they are busy, but that is to be expected. Front desk folks are very professional and personable, except for the one exception I ran into on the late night shift. Pool and tennis courts are wondeful, and the entire property is very well maintained. We did have one problem with a noise in the pipes in the bathroom every morning. They offered to move us, but we were so busy with baseball Spring Training, we didn't have time to move. When I checked out, I suggested that they have someone sleep in the room to hear the noises we heard, as engineering could not identify the noise when it wasn't happening. The front desk gentleman listened to my suggestion (not a complaint), then handed me my bill. He had dropped my rate by $50 and taken off the night I had the problem with the night personnel. (The problem was a vehicle outside our room that had left it's lights on, shining into our room. ) This was, by far, the most enjoyable visit I have ever had at a Hilton property, and will definitely return to stay for Spring Training next year.",28-Mar-08,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,$202

Plastic wrappers other assorted bit of things on the carpet everywhere but the candy beside the bed was the clincher. Moved rooms to the next building facing the courtyard and pool. This is definitely the side to request. This room was slightly better in the center of the room but when we opened the sofabed - DISGUSTING under there. There was some type of white substance smeared across the front of the TV control panel and on the remote. Other stuff on the arms of the sofa. Yuck. I assumed if you can't get a clean room out of 2, three is not likely any better so we cleaned the tv and put up with the debris under the sofabed. The rest of the place is nice, the courtyard and pool area. Excellent breakfast included. There was also a great dinner special in Lafitte's, and the service was excellent.

We ordered room service right before they closed and they forgot part of our order and we could not call them to get it because they left !! The manager Greg promised to make it up to us if we visited again. So in November we again came for Nascar and again checked in to our room to find NO hot water and hair in the tub !!!

This hotel is at the same level of a one start motel.First of all when you arrive to the main lobby, there is a musty smell. After the second day, you start to get used it, but it defintely smells old. The hotel room was not very pleasent. The carpet had several noticable stains around the room. The ceiling had two buldged areas that looked like they could come down soon. The room also smelled old and musty. The room floor was slanted. It was the strangest thing, all of the rooms seemed to be slanted down. As well as the walk way surrounding the pool area, as if the hotel had started sink. To make matters worse, I was offered a free movie in my room and when I was ready to view it, the TV could not show any movies. When the service person arrived, he tried for a few minutes, then said, sorry nothing I can do, good night. The pool area is decsent. However, I ordered several drinks for my family, pina colada and strawberry daquries and they were all very wattered down. It had no tast to it at all. The breakfast was good and some of the workers at the food area where very nice and helpfull. This hotel should not be rated a three star hotel. It is very old and should be refurbished ASAP. It is not on par with the Embassy Suites hotels that I have come to know. Please know that I have stayed in many hotels and travel often and this is the first time that I take the time to comment. I would decided on another Embassy Suites. If you like Hilton, then try the Hilton Garden Inn, these are newer hotels and have similar breakfast at most of their hotels (howerver not alwasy free as Embassy Suites).

hotel_112,hotel_1740,"Our 5th Stay at Embassy Suites North Phoenix My two girlfriends and I go each year down to Phoenix for baseball spring training, sun seeking, and shopping. We have done this for 5 years in a row, staying at Embassy Suites North Phoenix each time. We keep coming back due to the gorgeous pool area, which has the right mix of sun and shade and lots of chaise lounges. We also love the free buffet breakfast and also the managers reception each evening with free snacks and free drinks. The drinks are not limited to beer and wine, they serve margaritas, daquiries, and other mixed spirits. We always try to tip the bartender for their good service.If you go, ask for an interior courtyard side room, as the rooms fronting the freeway have a lot of road noise.The rooms are average Embassy, on our most recent trip I noticed the couch and chair in the living room had small holes in the upholstery. Our bathroom sink had some cracks. But there were no issues regarding functionality of the room. Each room comes with a microwave, a small fridge, and a coffeemaker. The wear and tear issues on the room furnishings and freeway noise are the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.Oh, and one more thing, we had really good service at the front desk when checking in. Without us asking, Pedro asked us where we would be going while in Phoenix, and took out a map to show us the easiest way to get to our destinations, without getting stuck in traffic.We will be back next year.",26-Mar-06,4,4,6,5,1,5,1,6,1,3,$202

Don't bother looking in the book in the room...it is VERY outdated.Ordered room service - it was the wrong order and no silverware was on the tray.Breakfast staff was rude and it took over 20 minutes to order.They gave me written directions to return a rental car to the airport - the directions were wrong.What were the postitives?

Only negative comment: the FB Manager should look at the Menue of the restaurant.

hotel_113,hotel_9478,"Odd Location, Nice Bed I just returned from two decent nights at this Hilton. The hotel was a big disappointment at first. When I walked in, the lobby was barely cooler than outside (110 degrees.) Checking in was quick, and they gave me a cold bottle of water, but the staff couldn't answer my simple question (Where can we get a quick dinner around here?) The decor throughout the hotel was old and tired, and the faint odor didn't help. The elevator was completely stuffy, so I chose the stairs after just two tries on the elevator. The room was just like the hallways - old and slightly smelly, but at least the temperature was lower. The bathroom was tiny, but compared to the rest of the hotel, it was beautiful. Everything in the room looked clean, but I didn't dare sit on the couch or the desk chair. The lamp switches were all slightly sticky, and I did my best to ignore that. As with all Hilton hotels nowadays, there were cards with instructions about how to get the sheets and towels changed. Since I was only there for two nights, I ended up putting the do-not-disturb sign out the entire time (no need for housekeeping to come in if they're not going to change my sheets or towels.)Two things made the entire stay a 3 star instead of a 2 star. First, the sheets were completely clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Second, the bathroom was clean, and the water pressure was great.In terms of location, this Hilton is apparently in a weird place. Two different long-time Phoenix residents had trouble finding the place because it is (a) not near most other airport hotels, (b) off a little-known highway that's only two miles long, and (c) near some bad parts of town. There were no restaurants or shops nearby, and driving back to the airport was also a bit of a challenge.",4-Jul-08,0,0,4,4,3,5,5,3,1,4,$242

We started to think that we were on candid camera as we had to go back down to reception each time to get a new room. Luckily we kept a sense of humour about it and the reception staff were very helpful.We ate in the bar and the food was good and reasonably priced. We had eaten in the restaurant on a previous trip because the bar was very busy but this time it was fine.The courtesy bus took us to the car rental centre for $5 the following day but be careful about this as you come in on a lower level and there may not be luggage trolleys.Going back to the ice machine I would recommend not accepting rooms that end in the range -16 to -26",18-Apr-08,0,0,4,5,5,6,6,6,1,4,$242

I liked the hotel's location between two expressways that connected to the metro Phoenix freeway system. The room was quiet, considering the close proximity to the airport and the major freeways. My one complaint is that there was the odor of exhaust fumes in the lobby and the upper floor hallways. I would suspect that they use a gas-powered machine to clean the floors in the main lobby. To be fair, others in my party could not detect the smell in their lower floor rooms.The kiosk by the front desk allows you to quickly check in as well as to print boarding passes is a great addition.

The carpet could have used some cleaning so make sure to wear slippers or socks when walking around. The beds are comfortable -- no back aches, etc. when we woke up. The bathroom is a little small but I've seen worse. They supply a hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower cap and mouthwash. The refrigerator that is in the room is filled with drinks and snacks that you have to pay for and it is locked. You have to ask for the key from the front desk. If you need a fridge for your own personal things then you need to ask for one to be brought up because there is absolutely no room for anything. The coffee kiosk located downstairs in the mornings is not always a sure fire thing. Two of the three mornings, there was no one tending it and there is no self serve option. You also have to pay for the coffee you get at the downstairs kiosk. So you might be better off making sure you have coffee in your room.The room was pretty quiet.

I didn't have much expectations since it's an airport property, and most airport properties are not as chic and upscale as downtown city properties usually are. The thing I liked most about this hotel was that there were several entrances and you could park your car near your room if you were staying on the ground floor, and it was very convenient for loading and unloading all your stuff. Unfortunately my key card did not work at the door nearest my room, so I had to prop it open when I went out to get my stuff. The larger high rise hotels do not offer this convenience, so if this is something you're looking for then check this property out.This hotel is extremely quiet. I got a good night's rest, and did not hear any freeway or airport noise from my hotel. I highly recommend this property for those seeking sleep. The beds are comfortable and warm. Next to the beds is a cool alarm clock that aparently is standard in most Hiltons, and you can plug your IPOD into it, which was very convenient for me.The room I had was a 2 dbl bed nonsmoking, and it was average sized. The decor is a southwestern style, which is a bit dated for my tastes, but hey it's Arizona, so I guess it makes sense. My only gripe with the room is that the bathroom door opens INTO the bathroom, not out, and the bathroom is a little small, so the door kinda blocks access to the shower if you're a single traveler and want to leave the door open while taking a shower to let all the steam out. The rooms DO NOT have free wi-fi, but I was able to pick up access from a neighboring property so it didn't bother me too much!I ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast. They have a really nice breakfast buffet with both hot and cold items, but I declined that as I didn't want to eat too much food. ;) The server was friendly, and he had no problems taking my custom breakfast order, which was not on the menu, but is my healthy hi-protein style of ordering breakfast (4 egg whites, and 2 yolks scrambled together).

Complimentry water and work out towels just like most hotels offer. Open until 10pm.I did not use the pool or the spa, but the front desk told me it was open til midnight, which is a pretty nice touch after a long drive (I chose to work out instead).This hotel also has a bar onsite and other amenities which I did not use, I would say this is a pretty good hotel if you're passing through Phoenix, or even staying a few nights.

If you are on vacation, and staying in the airport traffic pattern, you probably need medication. To be fair, it is clean and the staff is nice.",30-Nov-06,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,$242 
hotel_113,hotel_6934,"Great Hotel, loved this place Even though this was an airport hotel I really liked it a lot. The room I had (213) was very comfortable, had a pool view and was large and spacious with a balcony. There were two queen beds and they were so comfortable I hated getting up in the morning. High speed Internet was good and reliable. The reataurant was very good with a surprising array of tasty choices( I highly recommend their Fish  Chips) . The restaurant staff and front desk staff were really friendly and suggested great places in the city to visit and eat. After work I relaxed in and by the pool every evening and it was great because there were very few people out there most evenings so it felt almost private. The only negative was because of it's airport location the planes do come right over the property when landing and you can ignore it after a while but in the beginning it was noticeable. Parking was plentiful and free. Overall I liked the whole package apart from the aircraft noise when outdoors by the pool but I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good, clean, high quality accomodation near the airport.",2-Nov-06,2,2,6,6,5,6,6,6,6,4,$242

The location is ideal - near the airport, 2.5 miles down the road from ASU and near all the major freeways in Phoenix. The beds are very comfortable, the pool and whirlpool are nice (and generally empty), and the toiletries are better quality than a 3 star hotel.The rooms on the interior of the hotel (pool view) are much quieter than the parking lot facing rooms. Interior rooms also have either a patio or balcony. There is a $9.95 charge for internet usage, which I agree is annoying since many hotels now provide this service for free. This time I did go into the gift shop and found the prices to be quite high - but there are plenty of stores within a 2-3 mile radius so there is really no need to frequent it.",20-Aug-06,2,2,5,5,5,5,4,5,1,4,$242

Great location for business and near all Spring Training facilities in the west side of Phoenix. University of Phoenix Stadium, where the Cardinals play football is just 15 minutes away. This side of the valley has grown and has much to offer the traveler. The Westgate center, right next to the stadium has it all! This place has all amenities for the business traveler and leisure guests. I heard they are under contruction for a brand new lobby bar and will include the Link@Sheraton. The link is a great gathering area to do work on your laptop and printing services while enjoying a cup of Starbucks Coffee. I was blown away with the service the staff provided! This hotel gets it in this economy on how they treat their guests. I didnt get that at the nearby hotels during other business trips. I felt at home and welcomed as soon as i walked in.

The pool and gym is a quick walk downstairs. There is a concierge lounge with a friendly staff. The front desk staff was nice too. The lobby was okay but it seems like the rooms, even the ones on the club floor, can use some renovations. The setup is typical of a Sheraton with a bed, a seating area, a desk where I can turn the flat screen tv to face, and not much else. Not huge rooms but comfy for those who are used to staying at Sheraton properties.The week I was staying there, there were a bunch of teenagers for MEP training (military enlistment program) who occupied the pool at night and I'd see all over the property. I am not sure if this was a one time thing, as I saw a sign on the second floor for MEP. So they may be a regular fixture.The Sheraton may not be as high end as some of the Hilton brand properties in the area but for SPG fans, this is a convenient alternative.",25-Jun-08,0,0,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,3,$206

No problems with housekeeping; didn't eat at the restaurant.Some reviewers have mentioned the noise from the interstate, and though I was on the end way from it, I still heard some noise from the surface street on my end.

The spa is not on site -- it's at a mall 15 miles away, far out of the 5-mile radius of the hotel's complimentary shuttle. The only way to get there is to rent a car or take the Sheraton shuttle -- for $65.00 round trip. Plus the shuttle (a towncar) maxes out at 4 people, so our party of 7 would've required 2. The sales and marketing director was atrocious and malicious as he later reported that our party had demanded 2 limos to take us to the spa. Limos? No. Demanded? How about asked you to live up to your website promises. Other than that, the hotel could use some major updates and is pretty much in the middle of no where.

The rooms were adequate, although I asked for a different one after checking in so I wasn't just staring at the rooftop. My king room was plenty spacious and nicely appointed with a comfy bed, but on closer inspection, it was pretty dated and several things were broken (lock on sliding door, button on phone to call front desk, clothes line in bathroom, outlet in bathroom that would barely hold my blow dryer plug.) All rooms are non-smoking, but you can still smell the stale evidence of it's smoking past. The pool area was uninspired but nice and the pool was sparkling clean. Sun on the pool area only in the morning hours -- it is in full shade all afternoon. Very fun looking waterslide separate from the pool, although I saw no one use it at all. Tennis courts right by pool. The conference facilities and service were quite good, although the food was just okay. Hotel restaurant had very limited, yet overpriced, choices. I didn't personally pay for my room, but the charge was $139 per night, which seemed reasonable. Location was less than appealing, with nothing handy within walking distance. There is a walking trail along a canal behind the hotel. Not too scenic, but at least there was somewhere to walk between meetings. Otherwise the area is very industrial and right next to the freeway. I never would have stayed here on my own. Not what you would expect from Sheraton.",28-Feb-08,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,$206

The front desk was very helpful in suggesting nearby restaurants, particularly in recommending an inexpensive, local, very authentic Mexican restaurant nearby. For business travelers or families visiting Phoenix or Scottsdale for a short stay, this is a good, acceptable choice.

That is fine by me but our room stunk of smoke and had many burn marks in the carpet. Please... The room was just cleaned that day I bet as for the first 30 hours of so of our stay the carpet was still wet.

Ok at this point I was wondering if our car was still in the lot. LOTS of work needs to be done to bring this place up to par.

She indicated I was staying two nights - and I told her it actually was one night and she didn't say anything. Then when I received my key, it had a large sticker on it saying that early checkout could result in a fee. So I had to call down to the desk and indicate I was checking out in one day. Then when I checked out, they said oh, you're checking out early and I had to remind them that twice I had let them know of my early departure. Pretty frustrating.The room is fairly large by hotel room standards. King Size bed, small sofa, desk, etc. There's a $10/day Internet charge. I didn't use it so I can't speak of it's quality. Coffee in the room, as well as the customary ironing board and iron. There is also a small safe in the closet.The condition of the main room was nice. Bed was comfortable and looked relatively new. The bathroom had paint and ceiling tile that was chipped off in the shower making it looked water soaked. It was in pretty rough shape. The tile had spotty mold on the grout.I ordered room service and it arrived promptly (15 mins). I ordered the chicken caesar salad and some ice tea. It was expensive, but tasted fine. I left the tray outside the room and it was still there in the morning.The hotel is very quiet. I didn't hear any noise at all and I woke up a number of times (couldn't sleep for other reasons).There is no shuttle from the airport to the hotel so you have to take a cab. The cost of the cab was approximately $37.In general, this is an average venue. The group I was with had dinner in the hotel's restaurant and said the food was average but it took two hours to dine there because of the slow service.There are nearby venues (Marriott's and Hilton's) that I would suggest you use before opting for this Sheraton.",3-Nov-07,3,3,4,5,4,3,3,4,1,3,$206

hotel_116,hotel_7069,"Never, never again We booked this last minute and rather blindly. In retrospect Spring Training is not the bes time to look for deals in Phoenix, but we grossly overpaid for the quality of the property (even for a busy time) at about $200/night after all taxes and fees ($405 total for Friday and Saturday). The location is pretty much out in the middle of nowhere--right on the highway. It somewhat worked for us because we were all over the city as well as most of the surrounding suburbs. Getting anywhere nice for dinner was a minimum 20 minute drive (conservatively). Not to insult Holiday Inn, but that's more the level this property performed at.The Highs: Staff was great (except for the Valet that never showed up to park the car, but garage parking is a 90 second stroll and probably easier) providing some GREAT restaurant recommendations--don't miss Marcellino's!!!! Balcony faced the mountains at sunset, but obstructed by highway lights. Room decor was about what was expected from a Sheraton.The Lows: Our room faced the highway. Even with the THICK drapes closed it was nearly impossible to get to sleep due to the highway noise. Although EXACTLY what I've seen in other Sheraton properties, the colors in the bathroom seem a little more outdated. The tile around the tub was mid-1980's at best (an irritating pinkish-orange to match the marble of the sink). The worst part had to be the mold in the grout.

The hotel is MUCH older than it appears on the website. If this is an issue for you then don't stay here. I should also note that my experience with Club Level perks in other hotels have been far better than at the Sheraton Crescent. The alcohol is not free (about $4.50 for a domestic beer) and the evening hour'dourves were nothing to get excited about (cheese cubes, veggies, chips and salsa, etc.). Unless you like being on Club Level for other reasons than the lounge I would not spend the extra money here. I would also like to note that I stayed in a Jr. Suite and requested a king size bed. It was not a king size bed, it was a queen that folded out of the wall, comfortable but not what I had in mind. Finally, I called concierge for a recommendation on where to eat in Downtown Phoenix. I was then transferred to someone else that informed me that he is not from Phoenix and was not familiar with Downtown. I asked if he could find someone that was and was told he would call me back. I never heard from him. In my past experiences that is what concierge is for, they even make reservations for you. Checking in was a breeze and the rooms were clean. I would recommend this hotel for a couple of nights stay if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel but not a luxury hotel. Again, the website can be a little deceiving when it comes to the appearance of the hotel.

hotel_117,hotel_7092,"Good for a night's rest Booked this hotel because we were thrown off our itinerary because our flight out of Chicago was delayed coming into Chicago. The thunderstorm had forced the plane to circle the airport and were delayed further because the plane had to refuel for the long flight to PHX. We were supposed to get in around 5pm Phoenix time and then drive a few hours north to Williams, however that was not going to be feasible because of the delay of almost six hours. The hotel for which we were originally booked was gracious enough to understand and cancelled our first night. So now we needed a place to stay the night. The Sleep Inn Airport had great rates online and plenty of non-smoking rooms available that night when we booked early in Chicago. However by the time we got there they turned away two phone calls saying they had no vacancy. Since they had a free airport shuttle, they probably filled up with weary travelers like us at last minute.The shuttle took a little time getting to us, and the place where you pick up your shuttle does not feel very secure, but I fault that more to the sprawling design of Sky Harbor Airport and the not so great neighborhood surrounding it. We were waiting for another guest who had called for the shuttle but was nowhere to be found. The driver called the hotel, who in turn called the guest, and found that the person was in the middle of the taxi area. After making our way there to pick up the guest, we were off the hotel. It is not on the grounds of the airport, but not a considerable distance away either. When we arrived we were pleased to see how nicely lit up the hotel was.Check-in was prompt: Sign, swipe and go. There seem to be two parts to this hotel. An older part and newer part because the hallway does an awkward jut to the left and through a door on the first floor. Our room was first floor about half way down the hallway from the desk. The hotel was quiet as to be expected at almost midnight to 1am-ish. Room was the basic, no frills older Sleep Inn design of built in furniture and everything out in the open. It also had a stand-up shower only but had great pressure and extra hot water. Exhaust fan was not very good at all, but water vapor dissipaits quickly in dry PHX. Bed was average, sheets were nice, pillows were good. Steam iron worked great.In the morning the continental breakfast was your typical standard fare plus those wonderful make them yourself belgian waffles. Everything was fresh and tasty. Check out was fast and no surprises and the attendant called the shuttle for us. The shuttle took us back in the morning to the airport so we could catch the rental car bus to the facility and the driver dropped us at the appropriate place and helped with our luggage.All in all a good clean hotel to spend the night and a good value for the weary traveler.",2-Oct-07,3,3,6,4,5,6,6,5,1,3.5,$122 
hotel_117,hotel_1948,"Good and convenient We needed one night's stay before flying home to the UK, and booked here on the strength of previous reviews - we were not disappointed. Staff at check-in were friendly and helpful, the room was clean (and large, contrary to other reviews, but maybe because we had a King bed?) There is free iced juice, tea and coffee 24hrs a day in the lobby and complimentary razor/ deodorant/ toothbrush/ toothpaste etc if you forget anything. The pool and spa were clean and nice (we really needed them as it was 106deg F, 41deg C when we arrived!) and internet access was free on 2 computers if you didn't have your own. The air conditioner was a little noisy, but that's a small price to pay to sleep in relative comfort when its baking outside. The bed was fine, with 6 (yes, 6!) pillows and there is a fridge and microwave in each room. The free breakfast next morning had lots of choices, including fruit, cereal (even hot oat-type), a selection of breads 'n spreads and make-your-own waffles. There is no restaurant on site, but the Hilton across the road has a restaurant and a bar with sandwich/burger/snack type (very nice) meals. You can even get Scottish beer there - we had a guest beer called Kilt lifter! There is also a Denny's within 5 mins walk. The free shuttle to the airport runs approx every half hour, (takes under 10 mins) but you need to book it when you arrive at the hotel. If you arrive at the airport and need the shuttle TO the hotel, use the courtesy phone in the arrivals hall and they will come and pick you up.For a good-priced, clean hotel close to the airport (but not under the flightpath) you really can't go wrong here.",11-Aug-07,2,2,6,5,5,5,6,1,6,3.5,$122

There are 2 computers for guests and they did not charge us to print our boarding passes (some hotels charge per page). The pool was a good size. We spent 3 hours there! I liked the stand up shower (no tub). Not sure if the beds were uncomfortable or if it was me, I just kept tossing and turning (could be because I knew we had to get up so early).

I stayed in the n/s queen room, which is 'small' as mentioned by others, but has a little microwave  frig (although the frig had a pizza box in it, so the maid doesn't look there each cleanup!). Also has free wi-fi which is very important to me.The A/C is the typical, noisy one by the window, but works well. OK free breakfast (think carbs, fruit, hard-boiled eggs) and free USA Today paper.I went across the street to the Hilton sports bar for 'happy hour' cocktails and free munchies (as mentioned by another poster). It was tasty and there were free munchies, but NO free beer/wine anymore. (No restaurant in my hotel)Staff was very nice. I have no problem staying here again.

hotel_117,hotel_9401,"OK for what it is The only reason to stay at this hotel is if you have a flight early the next day or got stranded because of a cancelled flight. Having said that, it was perfectly adequate. They have a free shuttle to the airport available 24 hours a day, a microwave in the room, an ok breakfast spread starting before 5am, internet access, an outdoor pool and the staff was perfectly pleasant. The air conditioner rattled little and it was a little difficult to find the place (there's a 47th Street right next to 47th Place) but the room was clean enough and they got us to the airport on time. This is the low end of the Choice chain, so don't expect it to really be a three-star hotel. It's just a place to sleep. If you are catching a plane in the morning and have a rental car, I suggest you head down University to Mills Ave. near the ASU campus--lots of restaurants, stores and people.",24-Sep-06,3,3,4,3,4,4,4,5,4,3.5,$122 
hotel_117,hotel_5381,"You Get What You Pay For Pros: In-room microwave and refrigerator, menus for restaurants that deliver to the hotel, vending machines that dispense hot pizza (not so much a pro, as an impressive feat of food distribution), friendly shuttle drivers (think Cheech and Chong 鈥?MAN). Good breakfast, including do-it-yourself waffles, boiled eggs, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, etc.Cons: Postage stamp sized room, shower/toilet enclave door that would not lock, very noisy room. To catch the airport shuttle from the airport, you can only leave a phone message. The message fails to tell you that regardless of where you are, you must make your way to the blue diamond at the north terminal pick-up location to catch the shuttle (a fact that we did not learn until we called the front desk after waiting 30 minutes in the south terminal).Aside from the vending machines, the Sleep Inn does not have on-site food services. Instead, walk across the street to the Hilton and enjoy free hors d'oeuvres during happy hour (5-7pm) at the on-site sports bar. Then, walk through the bar to the restaurant and indulge yourself on a reasonably priced dessert.Bottom line: If you need to spend the night in Phoenix while you wait for your flight home the next day, one night at the Sleep Inn will not kill you.",12-Aug-06,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,3,5,3.5,$122 
hotel_117,hotel_2961,"Absolutely Fine We stayed at the Sleep Inn on the 15th May. We wanted somewhere to stay when we arrived in Phoenix at night before picking up a car the next day.First the not so good news. We rang up for the Shuttle Bus when we got to the airport and were told it would be 20 minutes. We waited for 40 and it didnt arrive, we rang again and were told it was on its way. We waited another 20 and it still didnt arrive. In the end we just got a taxi.The good news was that when we got to the hotel which is about 5 minutes away we got an immediate no questions asked refund for the taxi and apologies. They really dont seem that well set up shuttle bus wise. When we got it in the morning it was a plain van, all the other hotels had buses with their logos plastered all over. (on another note the bus only goes on the half hour so book early and be prepared that you may not get the slot you want)The room was fine, good size, comfy bed and it had a microwave and a Fridge. The vending machines had loads of microwave meals and similar stuff which was very handy for one night.All in all the room did exactly what we wanted and had a very convinient location, if they can sort the shuttle out it will be really good.",9-Jun-06,14,13,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$122 
hotel_117,hotel_3842,"Nice Hotel, Poor Service This is a good place for the money to stay near the airport. There is a lot of construction around Sky Harbor so it is a little tricky with the black letters on white signs to see where to turn and they are set back a little from the road. So if you get turned around you can be hunting a while. We finally found this hotel, and while we were hunting we called and honestly I let the phone ring until it times out each time with your party is not answering. Well I think it should be embarassing to any hotel chain when a customer is in line in your lobby to check in, finally gets up, is holding the cell phone in their hand and has to ask the clerk why he is not answering the phone and you have been standing there calling the hotel to see if anyone ever answers. I asked him if he knew what that sound was... The next morning at checkout, the response from the daytime manager was he was probably out smoking when you tried to call for directions, the only problem was there was another woman there who they claimed was a trainee, apparently they had not gotten so far as to the phone. I would have likely knocked $20 off my bill for the frustration; but if you don't have to, then you don't have to. The Hilton across the way has a very nice lounge (none at the SLepp Inn) and my burger was good as well.

hotel_117,hotel_1932,WOW! What a bargin Sleep Inn at the Phoenix Airport has a fabulous location and the park and shuttle is sweet deal. The 24-hour shuttle sets this hotel apart from others which only start their trips to the airport around 7:00. After an unforeseen late arrival I was able to stay at Sleep Inn a second night on a return trip. The Internet portal in the lobby helped me alert others of my change of plans and is free to guests. The staff is professional an attentive to needs. They have courteous and competent phone skills. Some bathrooms are set up for wheelchairs.

We found this resort to be an excellent choice for a visit to the Phoenix area. It is located close to several major streets and freeways, making local travel easy.Although the resort was full of families taking advantage of the pool area, we found several, small, quiet pool areas to relax away from the activity. The weather was unseasonably cool, so we did not take advantage of the lazy river, but it looked quite clean and well-maintained.Our room was not a suite, but a second floor king bed room that was very nicely redecorated and spacious. It did not have a mini fridge, although.Overall, the resort grounds were beautiful and the staff was cordial and helpful. We did not dine in any resort restaurants.Our resort stay was very low cost, we felt, as we travel often and choose high-end resorts and hotels.

hotel_118,hotel_9058,Spacious but dated casita Found the property very charming. Was not at all crowded. Less than a handful of people at the pool and lazy river which was relaxing. Minature golf was nice and no one was using it. Food was great at the main restaurant for light dinner (watermelon gazapacho was great) and superb breakfast buffet with great omelets.

hotel_118,hotel_3577,"Inconsistent but better than the reviews My wife and I spent three nights at the Pointe Squaw Peak earlier this month. After reading some of the more recent reviews, I almost canceled our reservation, but it was hard to beat my company's Hilton contract rate here. I figured if it was *that bad*, we would just switch somewhere else after one night. I have Hilton Gold status and they upgraded us to a Casita. A bellman escorted us to the room and helped carry our bags in. The Casita was nice enough though the look is rather dated. There is a stained-glass window over the staircase to the second floor, and no way to block the light coming in through this window. The bed was comfortable and the main bath was nice enough. Some have mentioned having poor cell phone coverage... there was only one place in the room where we didn't have a signal, overall that wasn't an issue.We were given free continental breakfast coupons and had breakfast one day at the Hole-in-the-Wall. As other reviews have mentioned, the food there was terrible and we didn't go back. Also the cell phone didn't really work in the restaurant.It was a little too chilly to enjoy the lazy river, though the water was warm and there were a few kids floating around. The whole resort had a rather empty feel during our stay, though the casitas seemed to be mostly occupied. The staff in the convenience store were really nice as well as at Rodeo Drive, and the concierge helped us decide where to go hiking one morning. We also liked that the small pools are open until 11 PM, and while they have a plethora of clean towels in the pool area, we couldn't figure out where to put the wet ones.We had a security issue where the back door to the casita (at the carport) wasn't closing properly. Even if it was closed, I could push it open! We called maintenance and they fixed it while we were out one day. While the door was indeed fixed, they left the other door to the unit slightly ajar when they left! We could have had stuff stolen out of the room. Thankfully nothing was, but it was beyond careless that they left the other door open upon completion (we are sure that we did not leave it open - it was obvious that maintenance was using that door while they were repairing the other one). When we called about this, they sent maintenance over rather than security...security eventually called.We found out too late that with Hilton Gold status we would have been able to use the gym for free -- the published day rate was $12. It looked like a nice gym.The location was good, the staff tried hard, and the upgrade was nice...but there are so many great properties in the Phoenix area, I'm not sure we would be in a hurry to head back.",24-Dec-08,0,0,5,3,5,4,6,4,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_4612,"Great Property We've stayed at this hotel several times over the last 5 years. Its a great property that the kids LOVE going to. Here are the highlights:Pros:-lots to do for the kids, mini golf, lazy river, large pool with waterfall-you need a car in Phoenix but the resort is fairly close to high end shopping-the hotel is well designed (but it takes a while to figure out) and allows you to park close to your room-the Coyote Camp is FABULOUS, say the kids, they've been to 40-50 hotels and they talked about Coyote Camp the most. Staff at the camp is wonderful and are the same from our visits 5 years ago.Cons:-no restaurants within walking distance -service in Cantina restaurant takes a long time (food is good)-service in Hole in the Wall restaurant is very SLOW-pool side service was inconsistent, good one day very slow the next (it didn't seem to matter if gave a generous tip either)We ate mostly off property but used the resort so service wasn't an issue.We've stayed in everything from casitas to normal rooms and everything has accomodated our family of four.

Nice pool areas especially for families w/ young kids.The first night I was given a first floor room (queen) in North Pointe blgd. Not close to main lobby and room was not in great condition.

Room was ok for a military rate but I would not pay more than that rate.An issue w/ front desk about a fax that was sent twice, but we were told initially was not received, manager quickly addressed problem and advised staffer was new an unaware of the fax log.Property has some maintenance issues, a set of elevators under repair for entire stay resulted in some waits.

hotel_118,hotel_9173,"It's falling apart - time for the Hilton Group to update this property My husband had to stay in this hotel for 12 nights, owing to a business trip. I joined him for the last 5 nights before we headed off touring. Despite having a high level Hilton Honors priviledge card, he got a very ordinary room, surprisingly small compared to say the average high end motel room, and was told nothing else was available, when he checked in. They gave him a few complimentary vouchers for the cheapest breakfast available on site, instead. When he got to the room, it had yet to be serviced. Two days later, he returned to his room mid morning to get some papers he had left inside by accident. The keycard would not work. He ran to reception where it was reissued. It still didn't work. Long story, short - 5 maintenance staff members and 45 minutes later, he got access to the room. Of course, by now, he was extremely late for a meeting where he had to make a presentation. They gave him a $20 voucher for his inconvenience!!!!! The room was very tired - furniture scuffed and old fashioned, drapes faded, paintwork scratched, bathroom fixtures scoured until the base metal was exposed, that kind of thing. The desk was too small to do any work on and use a PC at the same time, it had an old-fashioned TV with a poor screen. Worse, the airconditioning was extremely noisy and the thermostat very insensitive. It turns itself off for long periods, then the fan comes on at maximum warp to cool the room down in a hurry, then runs a little more quietly before shutting off. This cycle is not conducive to a peaceful night's sleep.My first day, arriving jet-lagged from the UK, they had a water problem. I ended up having a cold shower in the morning, but there was NO water by 10.00 am. Guests were told they could use the facilities in the spa building, 5 minutes walk away. While the water was off, housekeeping 'did' the room. How you can clean a bathroom properly and hygienically without water, nobody ever managed to explain to my satisfaction. Further, there was evidence of remedial repair works going on around the accommodation blocks, and the nearest elevator to the room was out of order for the whole of my husband's 12 night stay.This hotel has a large pool and water activity based leisure facility. This is ideal for families with children and people wanting to relax and sunbathe. If you spend most of your time here, you will probably consider the property not bad. If you mostly just use the rooms, you are unlikely to be impressed. The best feature, to me, was a reasonably comfortable bed.While the front of house staff were polite and embarrassed at the shortcomings, and claimed they wanted to help with the problems we encountered, they didn't actually achieve much or offer anything positive or genuinely meaningful to alieviate the situation. The other staff members we encountered - housekeeping and ground staff - seemingly spoke little or no english and just put on a smile because they had been trained to do so.

Dont bother booking- 5 years ago, booked, failed to turn up; Same this time!Recomendations-Shop at Basha and enjoy balcony snacks, supported by happy hour snacks from Lantina grill; Go to Elements at the Sanctuary for a good meal- a little pricey but the service and quality dwarf anything near Squaw Peak .Manager of Lantina- have buffet guests in one area- they need little assistance other than drinks top ups, and have continental breakfast set up so that one person can supervise (if you are that untrusting), but for goodness sake, make sure that people are served within 30 minutes of seating and get the order right!!Or employ people that like their work!Sounds like a harsh review! Would we come back- probably not due to the complete lack of understandng of customer service and value, but maybe, because there were a few that made it worthwhile- Felipe, the gardener at the top pool, Sam at front desk, and Patti our housekeeper, the gym staff, and some others whose names we didnt catch- the manager at the water ranch, the guy who checked us in, and our waitress on our first and last days.Your money, your choice, but for unbeatable sun in Sept, its a no brainer; just get out of the hotel at the weekend when the invasion occurs!!",17-Sep-08,3,2,4,4,4,4,4,3,1,3.5,$184

hotel_118,hotel_3490,"Lovely suites The suites at the hotel are of a very good standard. Our children loved the lazy river and slides at the hotel. We stayed at the pool until closing time at 7pm. However, I would suggest you put on some insect repellent as we were quite badly bitten in the evening by the pool. We tried the on site restaurant. The food was terrible. My son had the fish and fries and it was seriously overcooked, almost dark brown batter. My older son had steak with broccoli. The steak was overcooked and the broccolli was so undercooked it flew acroos the room like a bullet when he cut into it. The hotel was full of noisy, small, children so I expect if you're not a family this is not the place to be. We didn't mind this as our children soon made friends. Overall the rooms were of a very good standard, but I would say don't bother eating here.",13-Sep-08,0,0,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_4480,"Worst Customer Service EVER!!! Upon check in there was a line out the door, they only had two people checking everyone in, when it was our turn it was a quick process, we got our keys and headed to our room. There are no inside corridors so that was a pain, but we were able to park right outside our building. The Luggage carts were chained to a fence so we had to call the front desk so they could send someone over to unlock them for us, very tacky as it was 100 + out and we just wanted to get into our room.We got to our smoke free room - finally...and it looked like it was recently remodeled, nice large rooms, and a bonus to have a separate bedroom from the living area. The room however smelled of old cigarette smoke (which I am highly allergic to), my guess is that at one time it was a smoking room. So thank goodness we brought Fabreeze with us and sprayed the entire room down, including the curtains (we had called the front desk and it sounded like that's all housekeeping would be able to do for us as well)The first morning we were there, we were awakened at 8:30 am by the front desk saying our credit card had been declined (how come we weren't notified upon check in), I knew this to be an error as I had PLENTY of room on my card...I told them I would call my bank and find out what was going on....upon talking with the credit card company the hotel had placed 5 authorizations on my credit card in the following amounts....$1183.00, $1183.00, $800.00, $600.00, and $500.00. They couldn't get my card to go through...NO WONDER, they froze up over $4,500.00 on my credit card, and anyone who knows anything about credit cards ( I worked in the banking industry for almost 10 years), when a company does an authorization it puts a hold on those funds for 5 -6 business days!!! until the charges are processed.So they maxed out my credit card. I called the front desk and they said that was impossible that that could not have happened, I told them, the $$$ amounts that the credit card company had told me they placed. I told them there is no way I would know the $$$ amounts if the money wasn't being held by them.To make a very very long story short, it took 4 hours that day to get it somewhat sorted out, my CC company told me I needed the Hilton to call them and remove all of the authorizations from my card, the front desk said they were not authorizations that my CC had been rejected those 5 times.It took 5 DAYS to get the messed cleared up and sorted out (funny how they had called my CC company and had those authorizations removed - but declined that that could happened), The hotel tried to tell us that our card was rejected at check in....I don't know about you but if it was rejected at the time of check in...1. Why would you give us keys?2. Notify us at check in that there was a problem with our card.3. Ask if we wanted to put our room on another card.If our credit card was rejected the above should never have happened and we should not have spent our whole 5 days dealing with getting their authorizations removed from our CC so we could continue our vacation. We demanded that they compensate us for all the time and frustration they caused us and ruining our vacation and they offered us a free lunch (we paid for breakfast in our package deal but did not get breakfast that first day because of dealing with this so they offered us lunch instead) and $40.00 additional, we told them that wasn't good enough, that we felt at least one nights stay (we stayed 5 nights) was more acceptable, finally after arguing in the lobby they offered us an additional $50.00.Upon check out, on our final bill that is slipped under the door, there was a $75.00 charge for dinner (which we did not make) and there was only a $40.00 credit. OK can you say EXTREMELY UPSET at the unprofessionalism of this staff. It took another HOURS to get the $75.00 removed that we DID NOT CHARGE for dinner and to get the additional $50.00 that they told us would be credited to us.WE WILL NEVER EVER STAY HERE AGAIN...we are telling everyone that this was the worst customer service we have ever received. We did a 5 week road trip across the United States and stayed at some of the nicest hotels with the best services and this was our last hotel before heading home, and it was the worst!",9-Sep-08,5,4,2,4,4,5,2,2,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7375,"Just ok We loved the casita. We had 2 bedrooms upstairs, a roof deck, and covered parking. The living room and kitchen with minifridge and microwave were a plus. The hotel itself is run down and the nicest restaurant on site was horrible. The pool area is fun, but I recommend it for kids older than 7. The gym was very small. The front desk staff was iffy. The hotel is in an older part of Phoenix with not much life and the Biltmore plaza is dated and was under construction when we visited. We stayed at the Fairmont in Scottsdale 2 years earlier and loved it.",3-Sep-08,1,1,4,5,3,5,3,4,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1934,"Large rooms, great water park, great location We stay at the Pointe as a family at least once a year during the summer when they have the $99.00 summer fun rate. We only live a mile from the property but our kids love the water park, and we love the suite sized rooms (400SF) with seperate bedroom and living area. You cannot beat the location if considering staying in the Phoenix area. This is close to downtown (5mi), Scottsdale Fashion Square (5mi), Biltmore Fashion Plaza (3mi), great hiking (Squaw Peak - 1mi, Camelback mountain - 2mi), and freeway (1mi). Seems there has been some remodelling in the rooms since our last stay, as rough texture on walls has been smoothed out (popcorn ceilings still present though). Also added shade coverings on the balconies, which really helps with the intense afternoon sun. We always stay in Pointe South (this is a big property with suites and cabanas, Pointe South is where the main lobby is, there is also Pointe North with a seperate pool) in a non-smoking suite, next to the pool, room 2362. This is a king bedroom, with queen sofa bed. We were really pleased with the room, as normally always get 2 queen beds (rooms are a little bigger). Room on the East side (less intense afternoon sun). Furnishings look new, and very comfortable. TVs both worked, and bed was very comfortable with nice soft sheets and pillows. My wife is allergic to down/feathers, and was no problem having comforter and pillows changed. We also checked in at 12pm (4pm normal checkin) and checked out at 1pm 2 days later, with no questions or hassles or extra fees. We spent a lot of time at the lazy river and water slide. My wife preferred to hang out in the room, and relax. We did not check out the gym, although usage was included in package. There is an 18hole mini-golf which I played with my daughter. Also 4 tennis courts (no idea of pricing). Internet access is $12.00/day (in-room) but have free wi-fi in the lobby (which seemed to work in the patio area that liked to sit in.We ate at the Hole in the Wall, mainly burgers, steaks and chicken. Sat on the patio first night, and was disappointed with number of flies. Food was okay (kids eat free a good deal), service was a bit slow, I seem to remember the same problem the previous year. This was a holiday weekend, but restaurant did not appear overly crowded, and not sure why it took 20 minutes from placing order to getting burger and fries. Made use of the buffet ($6.00/kids under 12) at lunch. Never ate at the Lantana grill, bit outside our price range. There are a number of good restaurants within 2 miles.  - Golden Dragon - very good Chinese, Northern/12th St (1mi)  - TexAZ grill - excellent BBQ, 16th St/Bethany Home (2mi).  - Sauce - modern Italian eatery - pizza/salad, Glendale/7th St - PeiWei - Asian food (PF Chang subsidiary), Glendale/7th St - Moto - Japanese, Glendale 16th St.  - Aunt Chilada's - Mexican, soft chips (opposite hotel) - Carlos Obrians - popular Mexican food 12th St/Northern - Paradise Bakery - 12th St/Glendale (good bread, sandwiches)Fast food: - MacDonalds - 16th St/Glendale (0.5mi) - Subway - 16th St/Glendale (0.5mi) - NY Pizza - 12th St/Northern (0.5mi) - Stumpey's Pizza - 12th St/Glendale (deliver) - Papa Johns - 16th St/Glendale (deliver) - Pizza Hut - 16th St/Bethany Home (deliver) - Starbucks - 16th St/Bethany Home Grocery: - Bashas - 16th St/Glendale - Safeways - 7th St/GlendaleThere were a lot of people at the property but never felt too crowded, and swimming pools were kept very clean. I was a little suprised at how relaxed everyone was with the rules (lazy river and water slide). Maybe it is the end of the season, but in previous years were very strict on height for water slide and making sure used a tube on the lazy river.  Hiking at Squaw Peak, 2mi to parking, 1.25mi 1000ft climb. Very popular hike, good parking. Get there early on weekends. Can also hike at Dreamy Draw Park which is on the North side of Squaw Peak, lots of trails, and easy 1mi drive from hotel. Camelback mountain, 3mi to parking. 1.25mi 1200ft climb. Two routes, East and West. Recommend West route, but limited parking at Echo Canyon, more parking 0.6mi away. Get there early on weekends.North Mountain. More gentle, can even take the paved road to thetop. 7th St/Peoria, near Pointe Tapiteo (2mi). Cons: I got home and checked my bank account, and see a $360.00 deduction pending from my account from Hilton hotels (Hilton manage the Pointe hotels - there are three Pointe South Mountain, Pointe Tapiteo, and Pointe Squaw Peak). I knew my bill was only $283.00. I call and am politely told they put a hold on the hotel rate plus $50.00/day for incidentals, and should be credited back within 72hours of departure. Okay, how about informing me they plan to do this. Not experienced this before, and am a little upset this was not presented at checkin.",2-Sep-08,1,1,6,6,6,5,6,5,3,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_8958,"Great place for the family with excellent access to Phoenix I travel over 100k/yr for work and expect the best in service and quality. For our family vacation to Sedona and the Grand Canyon, I picked the Hilton Squaw peak based on location and amenities provided by the hilton website.Overall, this is a great hotel for the family. Free parking, 3 different pools, with a waterfall, slide and lazy river makes this an excellent location for a family with young kids. 2 restaurants onsite, a gift shop/ice cream parlor, a bar, a kid's camp, mini golf and tennis courts makes a stay here lots of fun.Rooms - we stayed in the north pointe (3 sets of buildings + villas) on the 4th floor in a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds. Overall, we were happy with the state of the room. It was clean, beds were comfortable, shower pressure was more than adequate and 2 tv's makes it easy to entertain the kids during the downtime between pool and diner.Parking - ample, free parking throughout.Service - excellent. Everyone is courteous and helpful. No attitude from anyone during our stay.Restaurants - hole in the wall is good but a little pricey. We ate there twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner. Food is quite good. Our kids ate free (for breakfast) which is nice (I believe it is only until labor day though as part of a summer special). The BBQ is tasty and the portions are large.Lantana canteen- not impressed. We went there one morning for breakfast. Hostess was nowhere to be found, service was sporadic and the continental breakfast was mediocre. We never ate there for dinner, so I can't comment on the quality.Spa and health club - I am a runner but didn't do any exercise on this trip (unless you count downing margerita's). I heard the health club is of professional quality, so I suspect it would meet the needs of most exercise seekers.The hotel is conveniently located near several of the freeways without being right beside them. We had no trouble getting to activities from the hotel and the airport was a 15 min drive.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially families with young kids.",29-Aug-08,0,0,5,4,5,4,4,4,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7198,"Good for Families Our group of 7 (two families with teenagers) stayed here for one night in early August, as part of a big road trip.We chose this hotel because we needed an overnight stop in Phoenix as we were driving from the Grand Canyon to San Diego. In particular we picked it because of the swimming pools, and these were good, we all enjoyed the lazy river, and the kids liked the slide. In August it was really, really hot, so we definitely needed the pool to cool off in.We arrived early afternoon and luckily could get into our rooms immediately. The rooms were really big, with a separate lounge area, fridge and coffee making facilities. We ate in the Lantana Grill and the food was really good, not sure why but the restaurant was almost empty apart from us, but the staff were very attentive - although there was a thunderstorm going on! We had breakfast in the Hole in the Wall Restaurant, which was also good, particularly as it was complimentary.Would recommend this hotel for families, and if ever passing through Phoenix again, we would stay here.",19-Aug-08,0,0,5,6,5,6,6,6,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1735,"We'd Go Back I was a little worried after reading some reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. Pools - We went to the water park on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, Thursday was fine but Friday was a little too crowded with kids. We moved to the North Pool and had it almost to ourselves until a mob of 20 bratty kids came in. Even with the bratty kids we still enjoyed ourselves, you CAN bring your own floats in the pools(and lazy river) along with drinks to the pools outside of the water park. Holel - We stayed in one of the half-suites for $89/night and it was more than adequate. It had a king-sized bed(extremely comfortable), a shower  tub with the vanity outside of the bathroom and a fridge in the closet. There was a stinky smell coming from the sink but that was a minor issue. Nice flat screen on the wall. I do agree with other posters that you can really hear your neighbors, but that didn't bother us too bad.Restaurants - After reading the reviews on here we skipped the restaurants. We walked in the Hole In the Wall for breakfast on Friday morning and left after noone acknowledged us after 10 minutes. We were impressed with the pina coladas at the hotel bar; beer and drinks prices were average for a resort. We ate at Gallaghers Sports Bar (right off the property) twice and it was average bar food, nothing spectacular. I do highly recommend Barrios Cafe, a mexican restaurant on 16th that was fantastic - the area is a little shady, but the chicken enchiladas were worth it. Staff- Concierge was very nice and helpful. We tried calling the front desk several times from our room at different times and couldn't get through. When checking in the girl knew nothing, didn't explain where our room was. There are guys on golfcarts roaming the property that will help you, but they expect a hefty tip in exchange.Overall, there was definitely more good than bad - I'd recommend this hotel with families looking for a nice getaway. There are also some cute feral kitties that visited us each morning, if you see them toss them out some treats.",13-Aug-08,1,1,5,5,5,4,3,4,1,3.5,$184

hotel_118,hotel_4893,"Perfect for what we needed! We stayed at the Squaw Peak resort in late May/early June and had a very relaxing time. I had spent a lot of time researching various hotels in the Phoenix area and settled on the Squaw Peak because it appeared to be quite kid friendly from what we read, including the reviews on TripAdvisor. Our kids, aged 8,10 and 14 had a great time. The lazy river and pools were a big hit, especially with our younger kids. The check in process went smoothly (we booked through United Vacation.com and got a great deal on the lodging as well as the flight from Denver) and we were given one of the standard rooms with a bedroom with 2 queens and a separate living area with a foldout sofa. When we checked in we were told to check back in a couple days about a possible upgrade. I did check back, and we did receive a room upgrade on about our third day at the resort. The upgraded room was a two story casita, with plenty of room for our family of five to spread out. Much nicer than the standard room.We stayed a total of 9 nights at the resort and truly enjoyed it. We had been concerned that the heat would be unbearable but as it was Phoenix was blessed with a few days of relatively cooler weather in late May before it started to warm up, gradually. Didn't really matter to us as we spent a lot of time around the pools.The breakfasts at Lantana Grille and the Hole in the Wall at the River Ranch were pretty good. We tended to go off-resort for other meals - there are some decent places to eat quite close to the resort. We did do dinner at the Hole in the Wall one evening but the service was terrible - in fact my wife and kids got tired of waiting for the food and left - we ended up eating it in our room.I used the fitness facilities at the Tocasierra Fintness Center a number of times and found it satisfactory, with plenty of equipment - although a couple of the treadmills were not very stable. My wife and eldest daughter also indulged with spa treatments, and although somewhat pricey, they did find them enjoyable.The River Ranch was the big hit of our vacation, and there was never a problem finding lounge chairs, towels, etc. - although getting service at your lounge chair on the weekend days can be a bit frustrating due to the volume of people.We also took the free shuttle over to the Tapatio Cliffs resort on a couple occassions. The main pool area at that resort is also quite nice, and I found the bar area actually a little livlier. The fact that we could use the facilities of both resorts is a real plus in my mind.I travel quite a bit both domestically and internationally, and while the Squaw Peak is a nice place, with decent amenities and mostly very good service, I would not rate it a premier resort. That said the value for money was excellent.",8-Aug-08,0,0,6,5,6,5,6,6,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_2004,Nice hotel-very big! We had a great room-no problems. Stayed for 5 nights for a conference held on the property. Only complaint: it was beyond hot the whole week but the pools were warm! It was like taking a bath; we swam at night but it wasn't very refreshing. On our last night we heard that one of the pools on the other side of the property was much cooler but it was too late to check it out.,1-Aug-08,0,0,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,3.5,$184

The facility itself was good, the staff and every employee we needed to encounter treated us with respect. Spending a lot of time in the water park I did notice some problems and the first being people being there that had no business being there, my impression was that only guest that were book at the hotel are allowed to use the water park. Over all I would recommend this hotel for people with kids who need to burn off some energy but would think twice if I were staying there alone or as a couple.

hotel_118,hotel_8542,"Not quite ideal... Stayed in a two-bedroom casita at the resort for a several day conference held there. The casita was in need of updating, had a musty smell, and my colleague and I had to call maintenance the first night because the carpet outside the downstairs bathroom was wet and there was a dripping noise. They concluded that the previous guests had probably left a leaky cooler there and brought in a noisy fan we let run overnight- it was there for the rest of our stay. The resort is sprawling- not ideal for people attended a conference who want to pop into their rooms in between sessions. The conference facilities were great other than the 3rd floor (rooftop) rooms, which were way too warm. The restaurants are OK, but the more casual of the two is certainly overpriced. The pool areas are lovely, but service all over the property is lacking.

hotel_118,hotel_1461,"The worst Hilton we've ever stayed at My husband and I just got back from a two week trip including Sedona, the Hopi Reservation, Durango, Co, and Phoenix. We are HiltonRewards members and used out points to stay at the Hilton in Sedona (fabulous), the DoubleTree in Durango, (wonderful), and the Point Hilton Squaw Peak Resort in Phoenix...not so much.First of all, the air didn't work - it was 112 when we got there. Nothing was ever done. Second, we had ANTS...everywhere. The blinds didn't work and the housekeeper kept moving our things around to where she wanted them. The resort itself seemed run down. The pictures made it look much larger than it is. A professional miniature golf course winds around the lazy river at River ranch and inner tubes covered the whole golf course. We, along with several other people couldn't even follow where the holes were. One minute you were on top of a hill, and the next minute you had to cross over a hole someone else was playing to get to your next hole. While we were there, they also had an adolescent basketball conference. Banging of doors, yelling, running up and down the stairs, and yes, one night some kids tried to break into our room. Unfortunately, I was in it! I chased them down the corridor and made sure they understood I didn't find their attempts funny. All, in all, not the most relaxing time. I must say, however, that the HIlton in Sedona was absolutely fantastic, as was the DoubleTree in Durango, Co.

hotel_118,hotel_2660,"Not all it's cracked up to be So, I decided for my birthday, I wanted to go away (but not out of town) for a weekend. I picked the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak because it claimed to have some really good deals for a pretty decent price. Well, let me tell you - going to a resort in the off season, is not all it's cracked up to be! When we checked in, the staff were NOT friendly, no one offered any help with baggage, and they did not give us the coupon book we were supposed to get or our $50 dinner coupons. Our room was okay, but the shower/tub did not drain. Our neighbors were packed about 20 to a room and there were constantly huge bags of garbage sitting out in front of their door. None of the elevators worked (we were on the 3rd floor) and none of the ice machines worked. The pool areas were nice enough - of course, when we got there, we couldn't get tubes for the lazy river because the pump to blow them up was broken. It just seemed like everything was broken or out of order. When we asked the person at the front desk about the coupons we never got and the dinner vouchers, he was completely unhelpful and pretty much told us, Sorry 'bout it - it was your responsibility. No, actually is wasn't my responsibility, I don't work there!! So, if you're planning on staying here, you might want to reconsider - the staff are not very friendly, and definitely do not feel they should go out of their way to accomodate you. I can say that both nights we ate at the Lantana Grille lounge and the food was very good and our server was an absolute joy!

I traveled with my 8 and 3 year olds, and they felt safe throughout the property.We hired a Town Car to and from the airport ($30 each way), then rented a nice Toyota for a couple of days from the on-site Beverly Hills Rental Car (competitive rates - no need to wait in line at the airport). Food prices and food were OK - one child eats free with adult entree purchase, and you can expect resort prices. There is a grocery store and pharmacy about half a mile from the resort - stock up on goods there.Free shuttle service to the other Pointe Hilton resort. That one had tremendous views of the city, but the famed Different Point of View restaurant was closed when we went.Downsides? Only a small mini-bar fridge in the room.

hotel_118,hotel_10542,"Perfect for the family ! We live only a few blocks from this resort so my neighbors and I took advantage of the summer rates and booked a Casita that included two bedrooms (2 queens and 1 king) and a downstairs (livingroom, dining, kitchen, powder room, etc..). We had 6 adults and three kids. Plenty of room for all. The kitchen came with a half size fridge so we could store drinks, food, etc... and not have to pay the resort prices all the time. The casita was nice and located on a little street that resembled a real neighborhood with the houses, tree lined streets and carports. This weekend over the 4th of July was very popular and the number of guests must have been approaching capacity. However, the number of seperated pool areas, restaurants, activity areas spread everyone out so no single area was overcrowded. Everyone had a very nice time, especially the little ones.The main pool could use a bit of a face lift but that is the only thing that needed some improvement.The service was excellent. I think they must have required everyone on the payroll to work that weekend as there were staff constantly running somewhere doing something. Towels were always stocked, food service was served hot and with as smile, staff members regularly asked if there was anything else the could do, the rooms were cleaned well and on time, we all felt very well taken care of.I would certainly return to this resort in the future and give it 4 stars (above average).",7-Jul-08,0,0,5,4,6,5,6,6,1,3.5,$184

hotel_118,hotel_5739,"Decent property, not great for business travelers Stayed in the Hilton Squaw Peak for a week on a business stay, and thought it was a decent looking property, but not at all set up to my unique needs as a business traveler.- The property is really spread out: it is a car ride or five minute walk to get from registration to my room, and another walk to the gym or pool.- No concierge lounge: if you want to have a breakfast and are used to hotels having a concierge lounge for Diamond VIP travelers, you'll have to go to the restaurant and be seated, which is a lot slower when you just need to grab and go.- Gym closes early: it runs from 5am until 8:30, which just doesn't work for me as I often want to work out after 9 or 10pm after a long day of work or after dinner.- No lap pool: there is a pool large enough to do laps, but I tried to enter at 5:30am and they said it doesn't open until 8am. Again does not work for the schedule of a business traveler.So the hotel may work for you if you are on vacation with your family, but as I spend many nights a year in a hotel, this hotel lacks the basic amenities that I look for in a hotel to meet my needs for convenience and exercise.",24-Jun-08,0,0,4,5,4,5,4,4,3,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7378,"Made for a great vacation! We spent a week at the resort and loved it. We have two boys, 7 and 9, and they had so much fun just swimming! The rooms are nice and spacious, and the grounds were clean. There were always clean towels available at the pools. Housekeeping was timely and did a good job of keeping our room tidy. Check in and Check out were easy. My only recommendations to the hotel would be to offer free high speed internet connections and possibly consider putting microwaves and/or minifridges in the rooms. We were so pleased we will be back for future vacations. I would highly recommend this resort to families with children of all ages as there is a toddler pool, a water slide, and two bigger pools to choose from.",21-Jun-08,0,0,6,6,5,6,6,6,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_6269,"Nice Stay Overall I was traveling as a single woman, and found this hotel more than satisfactory on most counts. I stayed in South Pointe, and was a little nervous about using the elevator at night because the lighting was so poor both from the parking area and, especially, up on the 4th floor. I hope they will consider improving the lighting as soon as possible.As for my suite, I couldn't have been more comfortable. Even the prints on the walls were interesting and atttractive. I felt pampered with the bedding, the furniture, and my own living room. Early in the morning, I enjoyed the canopy view of the tree-tops from my balcony, and even took some pictures of the birds in the trees.The water park was awesome!! Even grown-ups without kids were enjoying the pools and the lazy river. The big pool with the waterfall was wonderful, and you could quickly cool off under that.Prices at the Slim Pickens Grill were rather high - $16 for a hot dog and a pina colada smoothie, but it was convenient. The Hole in the Wall restaurant was very good. I had a nice dinner of ribs (mouth-watering), with the best biscuits I've had in a long time. Breakfast was also good, and the staff was very friendly.The conciege was very helpful, and had printed-out directions for the Heard Museum and the Car Rental Return at the airport. The location of the hotel made it easy to travel anywhere in the area.All in all, I had a great stay, and would definitely return again someday.",20-Jun-08,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_2438,"The Good and the Bad Stayed here on Friday and Saturday night over Father's Day weekend with my wife and two children, ages three and eight. First the good:1) The recently-completed renovations are beautiful. The guest rooms are spacious, modern, clean and well-appointed. The grounds are very nice.2) The check-in process was smooth and efficient and the front desk clerk was very friendly. A bellman offered to take our luggage and show us to our room.3) The water park was great! The main pool, lazy river, jacuzzi and tad pool (for the wee ones) were fun and the kids and I had an awesome time.Now the bad:Food service is atrocious at this resort. Nearly every experience we had with food was a bad experience. From poor service, long wait times and poor food quality, the food and beverage department at this resort needs a major overhaul.For example, we went to breakfast at the Hole In The Wall on Saturday morning and had the breakfast buffet. The eggs were powdered, the biscuits were rock hard (inedible), the bacon was hard, dry and chewy, etc. Not very good.On Saturday evening for room service, we ordered the special Family Summer Splash Pizza, Salad, Wings and Soda combo, at a cost of over $43. It took over an hour for the food to arrive, the pizza was luke warm, the wings had been burnt and had black spots on them, the salad for four was actually only enough lettuce for one adult, and the room service attendant made no effort to apologize for any delay. I ended up calling the room service line and asking for more salad, which I got.On Sunday morning, I went to the gift shop to get a cup of Starbucks coffee. When I pumped it out of the airpot, it was lukewarm. When I asked if they had a microwave to warm it up in, I was told there wasn't one in the gift shop and that if I wanted hot, fresh coffee, I should go to the lobby where they might have some there. It was only after I complained about the coffee not being hot or fresh that the lady offered to brew another pot.These are just a couple of examples of the problems with the food service at this resort. Which is too bad because the rest of the resort is absolutely worth the money. We got a special $123 per night local summer rate, and I know there are rates as low as $79 per night during the week.The only other issue was the high number of summer teen employees working there that didn't seem too interested in anything other than running around together and having a good time. I encountered several, at various times throughout my stay, that ran past me, one that ignored my request for information (he just looked at me as he walked past and never responded) and another that didn't know what hours the tennis courts were open till and didn't offer to find out.Despite these issues, I would recommend this resort, and do plan to return with my family, but will be keeping a close eye on the food service and may even go out to restaurants off of the resort grounds to eat while there.",17-Jun-08,1,1,5,5,5,5,6,3,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_2590,"Average We arrived on the 24th of may, and first impressions were average. Nothing really stood out.As it was bank holiday in America, the hotel was packed full of people, and out rooms had to be moved, so they upgraded us to 'Palacio del Este' which was abesolutely georgous. The service is outstanding, but the hotel in general was poor. The River Ranch was full and there were a school full of kids going there on a trip, which i found abesolutely outrageous as its a hotel not a theme park!I would reccomend going to eat at 'Gallahers' opposite the hotel, which is a sports bar. The Fasion square mall and Chandler mall are also great.",31-May-08,1,1,4,5,5,3,4,5,2,3.5,$184

Location is good for business as the hotel is right off the highway, 10 minutes from downtown Phoenix and 5 minutes from the Camelback/Biltmore area. It can be a good value mid-week during the non-peak season offering business travelers an alternative to a standard hotel room.",30-May-08,0,0,5,6,5,5,6,5,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_5854,"This Was a Good Value We stayed in the main building at the Squaw Peak for three days in April, and took advantage of a Spring special at $99/night (Sunday night stay required). At this rate, the resort was a very good value. It shows some age on the exterior courtyards, and should not be considered a true luxury property. But our double queen suite was very nicely furnished and quiet. The concierges and other staff were quite positive in their approach to guests.This would be a good place for a vacation with kids, as the free water park includes several large pools, a waterfall, and one of the longest lazy rivers we've ever seen. Each of the buildings also has its separate pool. Another plus for me was that the hotel is very close to the Arizona Canal, which is a great place to run or bike. One negative is that this hotel, unlike the other Pointe Hilton resorts in the area, does not have a gourmet restaurant. Its two restaurants are just average. The service at one of the restaurants at breakfast was so bad that I complained to the manager and we got our meal free. The other restaurant (at the water park) was fine for breakfast. However, there are numerous excellent restaurants within a 10-15 minute drive from the hotel.Overall, a bargain for the price and it still would have been OK at a higher price.",24-May-08,1,1,6,6,5,5,5,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_8118,"Great Place for Families I have stayed at this property twice, and in fact we are going back this weekend. The main appeal is that it is family friendly, has child care (a day camp) on site and also the nice water park. Most of the rooms have been renovated, except they left the popcorn ceilings. Another nice feature is the separate bedroom in the suites. The outside of the property feels dated circa 1970's, but it is solid, large and quiet. I never had a problem with noise. One tip: get a courtyard view room in the FRONT of the North bldg. it overlooks a pretty pool and fountain and is quieter than the South bldg. the pool also gets mostly adults.This is not the best hotel for a romantic getaway, but if you have kids and want to have fun, it's great. The food is fine--not gourmet but fine. the only thing I did not like was no Wifi-you have to pay $12 per 24 hours for Internet service, which I find tacky. For those without kids or wanting a more upscale feel try the Pointe Hilton South Mtn or for really intimate, The Palms resort in Scottsdale.",22-May-08,0,0,5,5,4,5,5,5,2,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1947,"The updated Casitas are great! I stayed at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak May 1-3 on a business trip and was able to book a low pre-pay rate thru the Hilton website. Upon check-in, I was upgraded from a king room to a king Casita since I'm a Hilton Diamond member. The first Casita they gave me smelled old and musty and looked very dated so I called the front desk to see if I could get a casita that didn't smell. They switched me to a newly renovated Casita which was leaps and bounds better than the initial one I had. New, contemporary furnishings, flat screen TV, new carpet, updated bathrooms-granite countertops, etc. Great view of the mountains from the upstairs bedroom. I really liked having a covered parking space-almost like a garage to keep your car out of the hot sun. The pools are terrific and the property is beautiful. I found the property to be very quiet and it felt like we were miles away from the city even though the airport and downtown Phoenix are both about 15 minutes away w/o traffic. The staff at Hole in the Wall was very friendly and eager to please. Good breakfast there too. I really hope to be able to return to this hotel again soon.

hotel_118,hotel_5965,"Weekend Getaway We traveled as a family of three in May. Here are the pro's and cons of the hotel...Pro's...1. Lots of pools. Most are very kid friendly. One was in the middle of all the rooms. I twas small, had thick padded chairs and two hot tubs.2. Very clean. My wife has horrible allergies, but didn't have a problem while we were there. 3. They allowed us to check in very early. 4. Lots of activities for kids.5. Wide variety of places to eat on property.6. Very well maintained property.7. 10 -15 mins from Sky HarborCons...1. I had to fix the toilet when we got there as the handle was about to come off.2. One of the handles to the french doors was missing... Not a big deal, but it looked rather tacky.3. Two queen beds were crammed into a VERY small space, which left only a small entrance to the bathroom. 4. The pool towels at the main pool complex were HORRIBLE!! Just picture the worst bath towel you can imagine, and that is what was available at the pool.5. Service at the main restaurant, Lantana was EXCRUCIATINGLY slow because only one person was working a very large area. We had to get our own silverware and track down our waiter to pay our bill. The restaurant was just understaffed. Our waiter did the best he could. He was just over worked...6. Lots of local high schoolers invading the pool complex. 7. NO WiFi in the rooms!!

hotel_118,hotel_2885,"Good place for meeting, not holiday I booked for a relaxing weekend and was rather disappointed. This would be a great place for a meeting but is not much of a resort. My room was off in the middle of nowhere, in a bland hotel wing near nothing. The restaurants were nothing special though they did offer a small variety of food and it did not seem difficult to get a table anywhere.I walked over to the central part of the resort which centers around a waterpark and that seemed to appeal to families so I would recommend for that. The spa was uninspired, and a bit pricey.I may be a bit jaded because I spent the earlier part of the week at the Wigwam which was a lovely resort with food so good I could dream about it!",4-May-08,0,0,4,4,3,4,3,4,1,3.5,$184

We stayed in a one bedroom casita and found the accomodations fantastic. The casita was clean, nice, and very quiet. We stayed at the resort and played by the pool the whole time. All of the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. The pool was great! This is 100% a family friendly and fun hotel! The little one and grandma played the putt putt golf course too and it was great. We ate at the hole in the wall restaurant one night and it was good, but a bit expensive. The campfire and outdoor band on Friday night was great too. The entire resort grounds are well kept and very nice. I can't say enough good about this Hilton property.

hotel_118,hotel_6782,"Relaxing I stayed at this property on business. I was in building 28, which upon arrival seemed undesirable. There were plenty of parking spaces in front of the building, but no elevator which left me hauling my luggage up the steps. The room had some signs of wear and tear, but was very clean. The mini-bar was well stocked but expensive (I suggest stopping at a grocery and picking-up whatever you will need). I liked the bathroom layout (shower/toilet on one side with door and sink/vanity on the other). The robe provided was light and comfortable. My balcony overlooked the dumpsters and service area, but I soon was accustomed to listening to the hotel employees conversing below (some of it was very entertaining). The first evening I walked to The Falls Water Village and enjoyed the sunset while having fish tacos for dinner (these tacos are amazingly delicious). The staff was very accomodating and professional. The following morning I made my way to the fitness room (be sure to refer to your map before leaving the room). The fitness room is like a small gym (very well equipped). Breakfast at Pointe In Tyme was nice with great service. After my meetings I visited the adult pool (great feature - no kids running and splashing - just peace and quiet with comfortable lounge chairs). Room service that evening was timely and delicious.

hotel_118,hotel_8966,"Great location, nice resort We booked a one bedroom suite here on Hilton's site for a decent rate. After reading some reviews, I was a bit nervous, but upon arrival, we found the resort to be in great shape and our room had been recently renovated. The main pool was a lot of fun, and although our kids weren't with us, we really enjoyed the lazy river, slide and pools. Everything is convenient. My only complaint was lack of breakfast options, but it wasn't a big deal. The website had said the room had a refrigerator, but the fridge was actually the mini bar stocked with items. We did notice some areas that needed repair, such as large missing pieces from the side of the pool in places, paint needed, etc. It's an older resort, but the landscaping was nicely maintained. We enjoyed the central location and spent a lot of time in Scottsdale. Ask the concierge for pre-printed directions to area malls and attractions, as well as movie times, etc. All in all we would stay here again, it was a perfect place to meet my friend for a 3 day getaway.",29-Apr-08,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_9006,"We loved it! We went down to Phoenix for the weekend on April 18-20 to escape the unseasonably cold weather in Oregon and I booked this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. It was definitely a GREAT place to stay for a quick getaway. For $150/night, it included nice amenities. We had a suite in the main building and it was nice and clean. We also loved the River Ranch where you can just float down the river in inner tubes, swim, just lay out by the pools, go down the waterslide, or eat/drink. We just hung out around the different pools all weekend and just went out for dinner/shopping in the evenings. It also had quick and easy access to the freeway and we were pretty central to everywhere we wanted to go. I also like that it's not a massive property where it takes forever to get to your room/food/pool. It's just the right size. We're expecting a baby this year and although it was a great place for just the 2 of us, it's an even better place for kids.

hotel_118,hotel_7776,"Nice Place but not as advertised. We stayed here over our Spring Break 4/13 through 4/20, with my husband and 2 children ages 8 and 10.Upon arrival, check in was quick and easy. I asked for a first floor room with a pool view but even though I requested 4 mos. prior they could not accommodate. We had a 3rd floor room with partial view of the pool. The rooms were perfect for a family. Two very comfortable queen beds, separated by a pocket door from the bathroom/toilet area, then doors again which separated the living area. This was perfect to put kids to bed and we could still watch tv. Also, my husband the snorer was kicked out into the living area/pull out couch so the rest of us could sleep and we never heard him.The balcony is so small and awful view, we didn't sit out there even once. I knew there was no refrigerator so we purchased a cooler at Walgreens right down the street and bought milk, juice, cereal and fruit so we didn't have to waste time or money going out to breakfast in the morning. We bought a big cooler and then just sent it home as luggage on the way home.The resort is very nice, well kept and beautiful. Very large palm trees and beautiful flowers. The pool area is also nice. The water temp was cool and several adults were complaining that it would have been nice to have it a few degrees warmer (it may have been 78 degrees or so). The water slide was very fast and the kids loved it. My kids also enjoyed the putt putt, though some of the holes could use a lift. We all played tennis one morning an d that was fun too. My major complaint about this place is that, I booked it due to the multitude of organized kids activities so that my husband and I could relax some. Apparently Spring Break had just ended in AZ so they scaled back on what they offered. There was a board posted at every hotel area indicating there would be pool activities every day at 10, 11, 1, 3, and 5 which included races, basketball games, water volley ball, slide races, watermelon eating contests, hoola hoop contests etc. Well we were there for seven days and there were two hoola hoop contests and one slide race. (that was it for the week). We continuously asked the pool staff when the next activity would be. They just had excuse after excuse. I realize Spring Break ended for them but the vacationers were on their Spring Break. My kids were very good at keeping themselves busy but after a few days it would have been nice if someone could have organized some activities for the kids. Even though I loved this place, this really irked me!!!!!We ate at the Hole in the Wall, very mediocre and pricey. The food at the pool was pricey. However, an adult sandwich was chock full of meat and kept all of us happy well until dinner. Most sandwiches were $9. Beers were $5 and up and mixed drinks around $8.We walked to Aunt Chiladas one night which was very good. Also Gallaghers across the street (pub food), sports bar which was good. Lantana Grille was very good. There are two hotel courtyards each with a pool and swim up bar. Both swim up bars were closed the whole week (also weird and disappointing), We enjoyed using these pools later in the day which was much quieter than the water park and very comfy chairs. AS there was no service here, we just packed a cooler and brought our own drinks,.No night life here to speak of. IN the past we have done an all inclusive vacation, where there is entertainment at night and then the adults sit around and socialize a bit. There was none of that here. The resort was quiet by 9:00.The fitness room is fantastic. New modern equipment, classes offered, it couldn't have been better.We went to the Grand Canyon one day and made it in 3 1/2 hrs. . Cut through Flagstaff and it shaves a little of the trip. Also went to Sedona one day. Awesome!! You have to do the Pink Jeep Broken Arrow tour as everyone says. Pricey but well worth it.All in all a good trip. The staff at the front desk and concierge could not have been better.

hotel_118,hotel_1589,"nice experience with only a couple flaws We stayed in a studio room nestled among larger casitas for our anniversary. Note that almost all of the rooms at the Pointe are suites, but a few like ours are not. Though small, we really enjoyed our room. The room was clean, the bed was fluffy and soft, and the location of our room was in a quiet area away from most of the traffic. One thing you may want to consider is that quarters are tight in the shower, and tall people may have a problem with this. Unlike the casitas, the studios do not have an assigned parking spot. We didn't have a problem though since there are some open spots you can use.

hotel_118,hotel_9676,"Great location The best thing about this hotel is where it is located in Phoenix. I stayed as a business traveler who needed easy accessibility to downtown during the time. BUT, as a former Phoenician, it also gave me great access to all the things I loved about living in Phoenix: the Biltmore shopping area, Scottsdale Fashion Square, Camelback and Squaw Peak. It is enough out of the way to give you the resort feel, but still in the midst of everything. Although I enjoyed my stay, some business travelers may find that this hotel is a little too family-oriented for them. I was there during the last week of spring training and it was P-A-C-K-E-D. However, I was still able to enjoy the property. As a business traveler, it is important to me to be able to maintain a fitness routine. The Hilton Squaw Peak has a very nice fitness center and I didn't ever find it to be too crowded at peak evening hours. I was told that it was recently updated, so everything was in great shape. (Only suggestion I have for the hotel: balance your treadmills...a few were a bit wobbly on their legs!) Plenty of cardio machines and an extensive weight lifting area. Pretty great! Not to mention that you have access to Squaw Peak trails which is a nice bonus for the months when it is cool enough to be outside.The rooms are also quite large, which is great for being able to spread out. I had a suite on the ground floor near the pool / lobby. Even though there were lots of families who were up late, I didn't find it to be a distraction in my room. I also liked that my unit had a patio - which again, is great if it is cool enough to be outside. Thanks for a pleasant stay.",18-Apr-08,0,0,6,5,4,4,4,4,4,3.5,$184

Despite the hotel being COMPLETELY PACKED (sold out w/ every room having families of at least 3 kids each!!), the staff remained positive, patient and friendly. I was very satisfied w/ the room lay-out. EVERY room is a suite and for a family, this is ideal!! When one person woke early or wanted to stay up late, there was a seperate room to accomodate that...really makes for a more comfortable stay!! On a negative note, the resort layout is rather cramped. When you add the crowds of Spring Break, it really was pushing it. The lazy river looked like a rush hour traffic jam! Overall, it was a great trip. I'd like to specifically mention the top notch fitness club. It was clean, modern and the staff were great!! Fitness Director, Keene was our guide on a hotel sponsored hike. He was great!! Kind, fun and professional...what more do you want in an employee!!

They could use some help there, because the service is slow. If you want to get some decent chairs, you need to get out there early. People do reserve their chairs with towels, although there is a sign, saying not to do that.We ate breakfast at the Hole in the Wall twice, and the food is not the best. Being gold members, we get 2 free continental breakfasts and we upgraded to bacon and eggs. You can upgrade to the buffet for $5. Make a reservation if you want to eat there.We got upgraded to a king casita, which is nice, although the 2 queen casita is nicer. It has a door upstairs into the room, where as the king casita does not. So you can hear the TV going downstairs. And the sleeper sofa has a thin mattress and it is very uncomfortable.

hotel_118,hotel_7341,"Good, but not GREAT experience We -- two adults and a near-teen -- visited Squaw Peak at the height of the spring break/spring training season, so it was packed. For the most part, we had a great time, but there were some annoying gaps in service/quality.The hotel is all suites (although small with no fridge), most seem to have been done over very nicely, with very comfortable beds and solid quiet construction. But if you have a bad back, get three people to help you unfold the fold-out couch!The River Ranch water complex was great, with mulitple pools, tennis, fairly boring miniature golf, and faux lazy river and waterslide (with great smoothies at the pool bar). However, at opening time, there was a long line of people waiting to get in, and the gate was understaffed. Concierge staff was incredibly knowledgable and helpful (thank you, Dave, Joan and Carol), with good advice on trips to Sedona and local sites and restaurant choices.The biggest disappointment was the on-property dining, which was mediocre and overpriced. We had opted for the bounce-back breakfast. The vouchers covered only a couple of menu items. The staff at both the family oriented Hole in the Wall and the fancier Lantana Grill kept trying to direct us to the pricey breakfast buffet. At the Hole in the Wall it was awful -- soggy french toast, cold eggs, a few pastries -- more like school cafeteria than good resort. (We DID love the Joshua Stone Band, local bluegrass group that plays Friday nights... worth seeing)The Lantana buffet was better, but more expensive... we would strongly recommend not buying the breakfast plan, and visiting some good local spots, like the 5  Diner nearby.It was annoying that while there was free wi-fi in the lobby, internet access everywhere else was an add-on.All in all, we had a great time... this is NOT a luxury resort, despite the pix, but a middle of the road family resort with nice rooms and a laid back atmosphere... just fix the restaurants!!!!",26-Mar-08,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,3.5,$184

The rooms are comfortable, the beds comfortable, and the grounds are great. For kids, the pools, lazy river and the water slide are tops. Hours and hours of fun. I do agree with one of the other reviewers, the Squaw Peak is beginning to look a little tired around the edges. The service is still great. I will say, the food prices on campus are a little steep, and the overall price for the room was steep. However, we will be back, again and again......",12-Mar-08,0,0,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_5361,"The Tired Casita We stayed two nights in a casita at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort. Other reviewers have mentioned that the property is upgrading the casitas. They definitely had not made it to this one yet. The unit had a bedroom and bathroom upstairs and a good sized common area downstairs. The spaces were okay but everything was really tired. The carpeting was dated and worn as was the furniture. It may take several visits to the chiropractor to recover from the fold out couch experience.The resort itself is actually pretty nice for a family with kids. The water park, mini-golf and sports courts are nothing fancy but just fine for young kids. We ate one meal at the Hole-in-the-Wall restaurant and it was better than average.The whole resort is a very large facility and if you're in one of the casitas, be prepared for a long walk to get back to the main areas. Also, many of the casitas border a residential street so you don't have the feel that your in a vacation location.All in all, you get about what your pay for which is a decent resort at a decent price.",4-Mar-08,1,1,4,3,4,4,5,5,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7385,"An ok place to stay. This was the last place we stayed on our trip through Arizona. We payed $206/night and stayed for 2 nights. It's quite a large property and we had a bit of a hike before we found the registration desk. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. Our room was on the third floor of the North building. It was clean and quiet and the beds in this place are AMAZING! Best sleep I had all trip. Our kids loved the waterpark, in fact they never even tried the pool in the buildings courtyard. There is a mini-golf, basketball and tennis courts and several pools on the resort. The mini-golf and tennis courts are available if you pay a fee of $2.95/day, which was reasonable, but we weren't informed untill we checked in.The things we didn't like:We never got a complimentary paper the first morning, and the gift shop was always out. The business centre cost $0.49/min for internet access, something that every other place we stayed at provided for free. The roads around the resort were solid cars at Phoenix rush hour every day. Food was very expensive but hey, it's a resort. We ate off the resort, many restaurants only a short drive away. Also, there was no fridge in our suite (unless there was one in the mini-bar that we didn't open!)Apart from these minor annoyances, we did enjoy the resort. We will probably try another place the next time we are in Phoenix.",27-Feb-08,2,2,4,5,4,5,5,4,3,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_3100,"Thanks for the wonderful upgrade! When we arrived at the Squaw Peak peak we were greeted by a very friendly staff and during check-in I asked for a free upgrade (rent a ton of Hilton rooms throughout the year) and the desk manager gave us a WONDERFUL Casita (Town home). Ours had a pool and Hot tub attached to it that could be used by the public, but it was very quiet and felt like it was just ours to use. Unit # 3243. Our unit had a kitchen, 2 bathrooms, and a nice dresing area. The bedroom had a king sized COMFY bed and it seemed clean. A little outdated and one of the windows was too high to reach the blind leaving a direct view into our bathroom at night (wouldn't want to be spotted naked). It also had a water fountain outside by the pool and we slept perfectly to the sound of the water. This is a great place for Kids and families, but still quiet enough for just the two of us. We strolled around the property and it has a very cool water park, mini golf, and fun stuff for the kids. You can't bring food or bevs from the outside into the pool area so a few drinks in the sun can get a little pricey. It was to chilly to use the waterpark for a couple of adults, but the kids were having a blast.We did eat at the Hole in the wall rest and the food was very good. I just didn't get the feeling that it was very clean in there.Walgreens is just down the street and they have a liquor store attached so you can find all your needs there.We ate at a fun rest called The Fish Market just a few exits down on 51S and it was VERY good! The chef changed a few things for us and didn't mind. (I like Pasta instead of rice). Although, they had security and so that made me a little uneasy about the area.",27-Feb-08,2,2,5,5,5,5,6,6,3,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_9674,"Outstanding in all respects Over the past couple of years, aging parent issues have taken me to Phoenix frequently, so I've had the opportunity to try several hotels in the metro area. After my most recent two-night stay, the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort is my new favorite. It鈥檚 an 鈥渁ll-suite鈥?property with lots to recommend it.Our plane landed just before noon and, after a couple of grueling flights, my wife and I wanted to freshen up and eat a decent meal before seeing my folks. When I called the hotel, the front desk clerk was very helpful and confirmed that the suite they'd set aside for us was indeed ready, so we headed straight for the resort.Upon check-in, which was handled very smoothly, we were informed of the resort option package, which provides a number of amenities (including fitness center access, spa discounts, and local phone calls) for $2.25 a day. As Hilton HHonors members, we were also given two complimentary bottles of water.After freshening up, we headed to the Hole in the Wall Restaurant for lunch. This was a bit nostalgic for me, as I grew up in Phoenix and friends and I had frequented the Hole in the Wall at its original location in its early days. The food was (and still is) basic burgers, sandwiches, and quesadillas, but well prepared and reasonably-priced (especially considering it鈥檚 in a resort). The service was also excellent.Thus fortified, we set off to see The Parents.Over the next several days, our two-room suite became our sanctuary. It included a separate living room and bed room, robes (without having to ask), a very comfy bed, the fluffiest towels I have used in a long time (at home or away), a balcony, a well-stocked mini-bar, and some of the best in-room coffee I've in a long time. While our room was in one of two multi-story buildings, the resort also offers casitas - single story structures away from the larger buildings and adjacent conference center.While the property has four restaurants, we only ate at the Hole in the Wall. However, we did use room service, which was also prompt, polite, and provided well-prepared fare.There are several pools available, including a small water park adjacent to the Hole in the Wall. And even though a fair number of kids were present at the hotel, it was overall very quiet.Plenty of free parking and easy access to the rest of Phoenix make this a winner in my book. Without a doubt, we will be back.",26-Feb-08,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1110,"Always have a great time here! The Squaw Peak Resort is a wonderful place for families. We never get bored with all the pools, lazy river, etc. Plus, it's reasonably priced. That's because it's probably due to be updated. It's a Hilton, and it's not bad at all. The rooms are nice. I think they're all suites, which is great for a family. They are very clean and decorated nicely, albeit a bit outdated. There are a few maintenance issues going on, but we easily overlooked that, and our kids couldn't care less.

We were placed into a 4th floor room that had ants running above the window and in the closet. After calling the front desk, they sent someone who sprayed. Ants were gone. Bathroom sink didn't have hot water, but the shower did. TV had a high pitched whine, that didn't go away after muting it. Both issues were reported to maintenance and repaired on the second day.Beds are very comfortable. Pretty quiet property. Limited menu selections in both restaurants.

hotel_118,hotel_4144,"Nice hotel, but a labyrinth I was here for a conference (paid $199 per night). The hotel itself is beautiful---lots of attention to detail with fountains, plants, architecture. I believe that every room is a suite---a living room with a pull out couch, TV, and mini bar, a middle area with the bathroom, and a bedroom and lanai. Room was quite clean, bed comfy, and new looking linens. I think I must have had one of the newly remodeled rooms---very nice. They seems to have an abundance of conference rooms and meeting areas that are quite nice. Cons*The bathroom towels were tired looking and scratchy.*The swimming pool is in a center courtyard and is small and shallow. Great for dipping, but not doing laps, and if kids were around it would be quite noisy. It looks like only one side gets sun at a time, which could be a problem if the hotel is busy. (I didn鈥檛 visit the hotel鈥檚 waterpark.) *They had a lot of rain the days before I arrived. I heard some fellow guests complain about leaks in their rooms. My only experience (on the 4th floor) were some small ants in the bathroom.*My biggest complaint is that the hotel is laid out like a labyrinth, with lots of little, dark walkways. I kept getting confused as to where I was and how to get to my room, the main lobby, and the rooms where my meetings were. Each turn looks like it鈥檚 鈥渨rong鈥?because it looks like a service ally, not like a main path, and the elevators are strangely located and even hidden in some cases. Although at night the property had nice mood lighting, given the small dark passageways during the daytime, at night it was creepier. Granted I was on my own---but if I were here with my husband I can see that it would have been romantic.",31-Jan-08,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_3056,"Need to complete the refurb quick! Stayed here for a few days in January and paid an additional fee to stay in a Casita. The fee was verbally given as $75 for the whole stay but on check out we the charge was $375! The Casita itself was well past its sell-by date. It rained one night and water came in through the balcony door, and generally the decor was in a poor shape. To give Hilton some credit they are going through a refurb programme so I guess the one I had was on the list.January is probably not the best month to be there as a lot of the facilities were shut but the overall impressing was that it would suit a low budget family holiday.",31-Jan-08,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,4,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_4425,"More than I expected Just came back from 5 days with my wife, son (16) and daughter (12). We were very impressed with the resort with it being rated as a 3 star resort. I am sure in its earlier days (before the Phoenician's and Boulders came to be) this was the place to go. We were somewhat hesitant to book a 3 star resort but came away very pleased and would stay here again.We paid $161/night with AAA and found that to be a good price for the room/resort. We had a two, queen bed casita with a pullout out couch in the common area. We spent sometime in the on-site waterpark (the waterslide was not open and we should have been told about this upfront) and had a nice time there with the kids. Coming from Mass. the weather was great (mid 60's) and certainly pool weather for us!Ate two meals (one dinner and one breakfast) at the Off the Wall restaurant on the property and found the food was ok and very pricey. Would suggest you eat off the property. By the way...there was rattesnake listed as an appetizer on the menu at Hole in the Wall. The waiter brought out a frozen rattlesnake from the kitchen. The kids loved that!There was renovation going on at the fitness center and they had temporary quarters (no charge to use) and had plenty of equipment. The new facility looks fabulous (I wish it was done for us..oh well). Other than that we saw very little renovating happening. My sense is that our casita had been renovated sometime in the past year. It smell very fresh and was very clean.The staff was great and friendly, particluarly the concierge.Tip of the trip: Make a dinner resrvation at Sam's Cafe. One of the best meals we have ever had.",29-Jan-08,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7409,"Terrible serve The resort looks nice from the outside, but once you get inside you can tell that they are undergoing a major renovation. We booked a 2 bed room casita over the phone for 3 days to accomodate 4 adults and 2 young children. When we arrived the guy took us to a casita and told us that we were in luck because this was a remodeled casita. Then he couldn't get the key to work, so he called up to the front desk and they told him that it wasn't quite finished yet. Then he took us to another casita, this one was not remodeled so we were a little dissapointed but not completely unhappy until we realized that it was only one bedroom. I informed the guy that it was not a 2 bedroom that we had booked over the phone and he had the nerve to ask me are you sure you booked a 2 bedroom. There was one queen sized bed and a full size pull out couch for 6 people. He then called the front desk again and they informed him that all 2 bedroom casitas were occupied. The guy then told us we could have 2 regular hotel rooms that were close to one another. I specifically booked a casita because I have a 1 year old who would need a refridgerator to store milk for his bottles. Also the bedrooms are upstairs so when my 2 kids take naps we can sit downstairs and watch tv or talk. So we stayed in the 1 bedroom casita for one night and after 1:00 the next day we loaded up all are things and moved to a 2 bedroom casita. This casita was not remodeled and the carpet was ripped in various locations. Oh and the elcetricity kept going out and we would have to have someone come and fix the fuse. After the all the trouble we went through trying to get our room correct the night before, they guy told us that he would get us vouchers for one of the restaurants. That never happened. Don't eat at the Latina grill the food is overpriced and the service is terrible. We didn't try any of the other restaurants after that. The pool area looked nice but it was a little too cold for us to try them out. This resort could be nice after the renovation is complete and they get some people who know what there doing at the front desk.",15-Jan-08,6,6,3,3,4,3,2,2,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_4287,"Good value for your money My husband and I picked this resort because it was reasonably close to our son's baseball tournament. Last year we stayed at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs and loved it. Thought we would try this one for a change and liked it's proximity to the freeway to get to the ballpark. We particularly liked the spacious private casita. We had a pool and hot tub right outside our door and it was never busy. We managed to squeeze in one afternoon floating down the Lazy River and going down the water slide. Great fun in the very hot sun! Ate one night in the hotel's Lantana Grille and it was okay. Another night we wandered down the street about 2 blocks and stumbled on the best Italian food in a restaurant called Tutti Santi. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but inside is great and we had a really fun evening there. Because the hotel is close to the freeway, it was easy to dine in other areas and we had a fabulous dinner at Roy's in Scottsdale. At this hotel we liked the spacious rooms which included a kitchen and we like the proximity to the freewy. At Tapatio Cliffs we liked the scenery, the layout of the resort in the cliffs, and the more adult-oriented facilities including the great bar by the big pool. The rooms at Tapatio Cliffs were smaller than casitas but they were very nice and we liked being able to keep our sliding door open all night. Although we really liked Squaw Peak, I think next time we will return to Tapatio Cliffs.",9-Jan-08,3,3,5,5,5,6,5,5,5,3.5,$184

We were in the South Pointe on the 3rd floor, which was the top floor on the side we were at, so why it's called a Tower I don't know.Lovely aspect overlooking Squaw Peak Mountain on one side and gardens on the other.Very quiet.Just a short stroll to The Hole in Wall for a great breakfast , then a stroll around the waterpark and maybe a go on the putting green, with an impossible Hole 17!!! for no extra charge...Perfect way to start the day!The whole place was immaculate .The Casitas were being renovated and when we return I think we will stay in one as they looked fabulous with very large outdoor patios and balconies although the suite we had was more than big enough for 2 of us a balcony big enough for sunbeds would have been a treat, but ours did have a table and 2 chairs.Also ,not mentioned on the hotel website, there are 3 laundry areas with washer and tumble dryers, very useful when staying for 3 weeksAll staff were very efficient and more so...David, Carol and Joan on the Concierge Desk were absolute treasures and whatever Hilton pay them it's not enough.Nothing was too much trouble ,directions, maps , things to do , shopping tips bookings for restaurants.They always greeted me by name and even allowed me to use their computer, with no charge ,after I had struggled with the one in the Business Centre.The Online Check-in point in the reception area is worth it's weight as it allowed me to check-in , choose great seats as they are very few 2 seats only, on 747's,and then print Boarding Passes all for free for our return flight ( which I did do for the my flight to Phoenix with BA before I left home)I have to say some of the reviews I had read did worry me but as I had booked before I read them I had to go and I'm so glad I did.Have travelled round the world and stayed in some great places , even The Four Seasons in Las Vegas, but this hotel did not dissappoint.",8-Jan-08,5,4,6,6,6,6,5,6,5,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_2931,"Would Definitely Return With the Kids Some resorts are great for adults and others great for kids, but this resort seems to do a good job of pleasing both. I came to it solo for a business conference but would definitely come back to it if I return to Phoenix with the family.  Most of the hotel rooms are clustered in the front of the sprawling property at its North Pointe and South Pointe. The rooms in each pointe surround a courtyard with a small swimming pool. The conference rooms are between the two pointes but the hotel desk in the South Pointe.  I was in a nice suite in the North Pointe that would comfortably handle a family of four. There was a living room with a pull-out couch, desk and widescreen for TV/Internet, a bathroom and walkway in the middle, and a bedroom next to a balcony on the other side.  In the back of the property are a four-acre mini-waterpark to the north which is exceptional, a kid's daycamp  Casitas suites in the middle, and a spa which includes a lap pool to the south. The casitas seem to be two story town house-type suites.  The restaurant which is off the front parking lot was not real fancy but good food for a hotel and fine for a family. Note that the waterpark has its own restauant, ice cream shop, etc.  The property has lighted tennis courts but if you want to golf, you have to go four miles away to the sister Hilton property. That other Hilton property also has a fine upscale restaurant (A Different Point of View) which is highly recommended for adults but not really for kids).

The concierge was very helpful in making dinner reservations. We only ate one breakfast at the Hole In The Wall. Nothing special. I'm not a huge fan of hotel dining. All of our other meals were outside of the property. There are plenty of nearby dining options. The pools looked inviting. However, with the unseasonable cold weather, swimming wasn't an option.

The pool winds around so it is a bit difficult to know exactly where your children are at any given time if they are explorers (but overall it did seem safe).

Only thing was the sofa was not a pull-out for the boys. So much for the upgrade - went to another King suite, but it overlooked some roadwork and looked like we would trip over the boys so went for a 2 queen suite, 1st one offered was not 2 queens, and with the bell - hop hanging in there found us a 2 queen that we couldn't of been more pleased with. Overlooked the courtyard pool and was on the 4 th floor. Only a few areas have a 4th floor and it was very peaceful. My partner is a HH gold vip so 2 breakfast coupons were included each day. The children's menu at both restaurants is very, very reasonable and plentiful. They have a lot of patio seating but very few umbrellas which is sad as it was too warm to sit in the full sun. We ate at Hole in the Wall our first night - convenient. It had a fire - pit that people were taking advantage of. They now have a resort special for $2.25 a day which includes an extra water park pass per day (not that anyone checks) and local phone calls which i'm using to connect to the internet rather then pay the $9.95 per day use!Pools were fine for the children, oh and fee includes the mini golf now. can't really sit in one spot and see the children all the time, so we found ourselves up and down looking for them even though they are 9 and 13 yrs!

We booked the Pointe Hilton Sqauw Peak for a week (8/22-8/29). We have 3 children (2, 8, 10). They have a great water park and two wonderful pools. The hotel was clean and everything was well maintained. We decided to go to Sedona for a day. It was beautiful but a bit boring for the kids so we drove to Slide (slip?)Rock State Park. Everyone enjoyed this river slide and the scenery is also wonderful. The kids didn't want to leave. Since we were halfway to the south rim of the Grand Canyon, we decided to go and catch the sunset. On the way, we called inside the park for a hotel room and got lucky. Incredible!!! Pictures can't do it justice. The next day, we took the in-park tour buses at no extra charge - although, the national parks should be free for US citizens, since we pay taxes. we left midday and drove back to Phoenix. A few days later, we made another day trip to Slide rock again. On the way we went to Montezuima's Castle and meteor crater (pretty cool but not worth the $38 for 2 adults and 2 chilldren over 2).

It had a nice, large living room, and a large bedroom. We even had our own parking space, which was nice and stress-free. The pool area is great. They have a lazy river, waterslide, water volleyball, and mini-golf. The kids also like the western themed restaurant.",2-Sep-07,1,1,6,6,6,6,6,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1366,"Good nights rest I booked this from the hotel website and the room was described as a studio not a suite. We found our way easily from Sky Harbour airport and check in was quick and easy and we were directed to the back of the resort and led up some outside steps at the top of which was our room. Apparently it was a lock off to one of the casitas, and as such it had no parking space, but we were able to park on the roadway just outside of the yard area. We were travelling on to Sedona so only wanted a good nights sleep after travelling for 24 hours from the UK.The room consisted of a king bed , night stands, tv, washbasin and separate bathroom. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, the area very quiet and we were very pleased with what we got.The rate of $79 included complimentary continental breakfast, but there were other options on the menu which could be substituted and the difference paid. After breakfast we were able to relax at the pool area before continuing our journey.",2-Sep-07,3,3,6,5,4,6,6,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_2911,"A treat for the kids Overall we enjoyed our stay here. The pools made the whole trip worth it, since it was 115 degrees and we had no desire to leave the hotel area. The rooms (in the casitas) were large but the furnishings a little drab and we did find a couple of roaches in the kitchen. A few items would have helped -- like a toaster and maybe a kitchen trash can that could hold more than a cereal box. It would have been nice if the pools had been open a little later than 8 on such hot nights though, and the little pools around the casitas were mobbed, and hot and felt oily. It was nice to have laundry facilities right near the rooms, and the shops were convenient for buying small items. The fitness center was well equipped but the employees were so snooty toward the paying hotel guests that they made us feel very unwelcome. Apparently it is a fitness club for local residents too.We're not terribly fussy, but I think that the rooms could be updated and a little cleaner. The pools also showed signs of wear (chipping tiles) all around the shallow end. On one hot afternoon the whole pool had to be closed (for the night)because a child had gone to the bathroom, so that was a huge disappointment. But generally, our 4 kids had a great time--ages 10-17-- and it was relaxing to sit around the pool and see them easily entertained through most of the 3 days we were there.",1-Sep-07,2,2,6,5,6,4,5,5,6,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_10140,"Somehwat Disappointed Although the resort was lush and green and looked inviting from the outside, I was a bit disappointed in the suite itself.As I work in the Hotel and Hospitality industry in Las Vegas, I took notice to certain things regarding the room itself. I was disappointed when I did not see a luggage rack. The waste basket in the powder room had a very narrow opening and in my opinion, wasn't very effective.We stayed in the north building adjacent to the pool area and a couple of the restarants and shopping. However, I felt like the map of the campus was really not to scale since we had to drive all over looking for the Spa and Salon the following morning and hoping we weren't late to out appointment. The building for the Spa and Salon was not signed very well and with the construction going on it was difficult to manuever around the campus.The Spa and Salon was a treat and the staff was very welcoming and made both myself and my sister feel well taken care of and pampered. The Cranberry/Apple ice tea they offered us was delicious.Since I prepaid through Hotels.com and just posted a credit card for incidentals, check out was a breeze however I was disappointed that I wasn't asked how the room was, how are stay was or anything. I also had to report that on the morning of check out, we found ants in the room. The agent made note but didn't seem too concerned nor did she offer apologies.I also didn't notice until I returned home to Las Vegas that evening that I had 4 bites on my foot and ankle. Mosquito, ant or bed bug I don't know but after a week they are still not gone.My overall opinion of the resort is fair and I would score it a 3 but I don't know that I would return.",27-Aug-07,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184

The main pool really made a positive impression on my 5 and 8 year old girls. There were a lot of lifeguards, a big plus given its size. The attractions surrounding the pool were run down. It was not clear if that part is going to be renovated. All in all, it has high potential I would stay here again.",8-Aug-07,2,2,6,5,4,6,6,6,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_5314,"No thanks. Finish your remodeling ! We booked our trip to have our family all together, three generations. First impression was the hotel is under MAJOR construction, taped off loby, much of parking area, roll back dump trailers, etc. We could not easily get into lobby to check in. We met my parents in the lobby who were also checking in at the same time. They were frustrated also. My daughter's family had checked in allready, and we all had notes of requests on our reservations to be in same building. No notes, and had to redo 2 of our rooms after checked in. They missed this. Went to pool area after check in and the entire water park area was a mess of dirt on chairs and patio. Bathroom was DISGUSTING! I also have a pool and live in the area, and fully understand the previous nights diust blowing, but it takes so little to hose things off and the pool chairs. . This is a Hilton hotel, and I have stayed at cleaner Motel 6;s with cleaner pool areas. The pool water was not all that clean looking either, little green looking. Dinner for 4, 3 casadillas and 1 chicken fried steak, 3 drinks, 2 sodas was $85.00 for dinner. Band at pool was ok. Our tub and my fathers tub did not drain. They had no hot water for their shower. No ice machines worked in our north building on the 1st, 2nd, nor 3rd floor. Room service did bring a bucket of ice promptly. The north building elevator scared us to death. We were on the 3rd floor and chose to use the stars, even in the heat. Room was nice for family. We had a king suite. My room check out price was charged higher on my card, in process of getting that rate fixed. We did the express check out from our room, with no using of any extras. Good place for tons of little kids to swim. My 4 grandchildren had a good time ( 2 to 7 years old ). But, we will not return.",26-Jul-07,6,5,3,5,4,2,3,5,3,3.5,$184

I am a Hilton Diamond member, so that is always nice. If you are traveling with children or friends, I highly recommend it. The other Pointe Hilton (Tapatio Cliffs, is only about 5 minutes away, and a better choice If you are staying here for business, a round of golf or with your significant other. The Squaw Peak resort offers a water park and more fun activities and restaurants, but with that brings lots of kids!A hotel like this will keep you going back to Arizona to relax....but watch out...you won't get cell phone reception in many places of this hotel.",21-Jul-07,2,2,6,6,5,6,5,5,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1614,"Fab-u-lous This hotel is just beautiful. Definitely the cleanest hotel I've ever stay at and I use to work at a Holiday Inn. House keeping was very quick with any request. Front desk was a little slow. Needed more help during check in. Everything else was perfect. The beds and bedding were so comfy. Everyone working there told us it was a 5 hour drive to the Grande Canyon but it's not. My mom, sister and I did it in 4 hours and we stopped to eat along the way. The drive is soooo beautiful the time in the car fly's by. After speaking with other guest we were told to go to Sedona. If you're going to Arizona you must visit this town. It was every bit as beautiful as the canyon. Also, there is a little restaurant called Gallagher鈥檚 across the street from the hotel that I highly recommend. Its a little sports bar with pool tables, video poker and a great menu with very cheap prices! Much cheaper than the hotel restaurants. Hotel gift shop prices were comparable to other local souvenir stores so don鈥檛 bother shopping around. Definitely go to the 5th ave shops in Scottsdale and for those of you who like to party you must visit Barcelona in Scottsdale as well. Dress up, it is a very classy, fun place to party and dance.

hotel_118,hotel_10156,"Great place for a family Just returned from a stay this past week. There were two of us traveling with our three year old daughter. our suite was remodeled, and very spacious. My husband likes to stay up late watching television, so we were able to close off the bedroom and sleep without being disturbed by the tv. There was an enormous line at check-in, but the man who checked us in was very friendly and apologized for the wait. Overall, I would say that the staff was very friendly.Room service was lacking, and I would not recommend spending the money on it. There are two places to eat at the River Ranch, which were both good, if a bit overpriced. Beware the extremely high prices for drinks. Previous reviewers have mentioned the crowding at the River Ranch. I would have to agree with them. It appears that people stake out chairs early in the morning, then come and go throughout the day, leaving few to no chairs available. We were able to find chairs by going to the pool in the early evening and staying until they closed. With the 115+ degree heat that Phoenix was experiencing, it worked out well for us not to be out there in the hottest part of the day, anyway. Overall, I would recommend this property to families, due to the activities and the size of the rooms.",7-Jul-07,0,0,5,6,5,6,3,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_5664,"Enjoyed our stay We stayed here for 2 nights and really enjoyed the resort. We were in the south section, and the rooms were very clean, comfortable, and well-suited for a family with 2 teenagers. The early risers could section off the room to read or watch TV. The only drawback was the lack of a refrigerator to have cold water, milk, or juice. The pools were nice but bring sandals. The concrete is extremely hot on bare feet. There are no in-room safes but the desk was fairly quick to allow us access to the safes that they provide. The weekend concierge was excellent with recommendations on local restaurants, laundry facilities in the area, and grocery stores to shop for snacks.

Upon arrival, the front desk staff could not have seemed to care any less if we were there or not. After travelling all day just to get there, and arriving in 111 degree heat, I was hoping for a line that would at least go quickly (it didn't), or at least front desk personnel that seemed to care (they didn't). Even a smile would have been ok. They finally, lazily, called more staff to the front desk after we had been waiting (with two children!) for 10 about minutes.Also, each night that we were there we heard the people in the room above us-- they woke us up with the television, their laughing, and their fooling around. My daughter asked me what those noises were, and I had to make something up to answer her! I told a manager, but he didn't seem to care too much either.The pool area was fun, and we were waited on quickly and often-- that was nice. But people were bringing chairs right into the pool, which I thought was rather dangerous,  the pool staff didn't seem to care about that either. Maybe the heat had gotten to all of the staff, who knows. But I would not recommend staying here to anyone.",21-Jun-07,6,3,3,2,4,4,2,2,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_3512,"Paradise for the preteens I booked this hotel because I wanted to make sure that my 10-year-old enjoyed our quick trip to Phoenix, and TripAdvisor indicated that the PHSPR was a top choice for families. We could not have made a better choice in that regard. He loved the pool, the lazy river, the water volleyball and basketball, and the Saturday night Dive In movie. The pool employees are like camp counselors, young and energetic, with lots of games and contests. He could have easily spent 12 hours a day at the pool if we had let him. We did not have a suite, but our room was spacious, stylishly decorated and much nicer than I expected. The air conditioner was noisy (we're not used to air conditioning) but we had no problem sleeping. We could not hear any noise from the adjoining units, and the resort itself was quiet at night. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, pertains to my observation that many people at the pool were not staying at the hotel. According to my Phoenix friends, resort-crashing is common, but the result was that during the hottest part of the day, the pool was almost unbearably crowded. As a corollary, I had a very tough time finding a place to sit by the pool, as towels covered all the lounges. I was not swimming, just wanting to watch my son, and most of the time I sat on the edge of the pool because all the chairs were reserved--even though no one ever came to sit in them. It was annoying, and since the pool management doesn't seem to care about this practice, my advice to anyone planning to stay at the PHSPR is to show up when the pool opens and place towels on at least twice as many chairs as you think you might need. All in all, a pleasant getaway, and a huge hit with my boy.",29-May-07,3,2,4,6,4,6,4,4,1,3.5,$184

The nearby preserve was great for taking a jog or walk in the morning. Fitness center was very nice also. Very kid friendly, but also adult oriented. Many of the pools were very private and quiet.

The water slide, lazy river, main pool, mini golf and tennis are all situated in its own campus. This made it very manageable to due a variety of activities in a day. Also, there were at least three additional organized kid contests per day like a balloon toss and slide race. Staff and pool crew were friendly and helpful. The pool food and Hole in the Wall dining choices were fine and what is to be expected with good deals for kids meals.

This was supposed to be a very good quality Hilton,not so! We had an 18 NIGHT STAY. Do not be fooled by the fantastic pictures in the holiday booksof the pool. looks fantastic but it was FREEZING cold as was the river ranch(though that was heated by the third day)We always phone any hotel prior to booking as we have a disabled child that can not go into cold water ,we were assured that the pool was heated ALL year round.to 78/82 After complaining as did other guests, we were told so many differentexcuses too many to say but all were rubbish.In the end the pool stayed friged and unusable for the full 18 nights.no one could use the pool. we tried to complain every day nothing was ever done.Also out of all the hot tubs NONE were working, some had no lights around them working, the bubbles did not work and some were also cold. the tiles were chipped and hanging off. which meant sharp edgesOur chill out time to sit in one with a glass of wine when the kids were in bed..did not happen. when we tried to compain we were told that it would be rectified but in the mean time we were told to walk from our room accross a very large dark car park through the lobby and try the one there!! The lights did not work!! nor did the bubbles. They did manage to heat one but that was all, no lights and when we put the bubbles on it emptied the hot tub.The ranch staff....(except Little old Lil) rude abrupt slack sevice, the food was at best a fast food cafe, As we have stayed in the US somany times were very well accustomed to the tipping culture. We always tip, what we do not like nor appreciate is being told that the bill does not cover their gratuity/tip while we were still in themiddle of our meal. on many different occaisons the order was wrong, we did not get cutlery, the drink was sloshed over the table as it was slammed down, our daughters we not even spoken to nor was there any pleasant banter. Even after all this we still tipped $150 in the first week hoping to get a better sevice.!!(one day our 9yr old founda large black hair in her breakfast!!) We never complaind about any of this but we know of Canadians and Americans that we befreindedbooked out to go and stay in the Scotsdale Hospitality suites (we aslo have stayed there in the past its FANTASIC) the front desk staff at the hilton appeared nice enough but actually did NOTHING to help.The whole Hilton experiance has led us to book to go to Tunisa North Africa where we know we will get better treatment at a fraction of the cost. the Tattersall family UNITED KINGDOM",26-Apr-07,11,6,1,6,3,4,5,2,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_6550,"Highly recommend for Families We just returned from a 7 night stay at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and have to stay I was pleasantly impressed. This is a very good resort for families - esp. those with young children. We have a 4 year old and a 7 year old and they really loved the Resort. They (and we) think the best part is the Coyote Camp - the childrens program. The Camp is very profesionally run and every day offers different activities centered on Arizona and its culture. I feel like my kids actually LEARNED something plus they made new friends. The Resort was fully booked during our stay and while it was crowded; rarely was it so crowded that it affected our enjoyment. A lot of days however, the kids preferred going to the smaller pool outside of our suite. I did expect the River Ranch to be bigger than it was. The lazy river is long and winding, but the main pool is really NOT that big. As for the restaurants at the property, they need to get their act together a little better at the Hole in the Wall ranch. We went there several times, and they could never get our order right. It was worth an evening dessert stop for the S'mores. For a very similar price and 200% better service and food, go to the Lantana Grille instead. Much more varied menu at the Lantana Grill - everything from sandwiches to gourmet entrees. Poolside service ran from mediocre to poor... again lack of experience on the servers part. Several times my husband would order something and when the bill came the item was $1 to $2 more expensive; they would tell us we were looking at old menus.The resort was cleaner and more up to date than I expected but then again I had low expectations after reading this website. We were in the South section which is where the renovated rooms are. Our room was clean and with plenty of room for two adults and two kids. Being so close to the pool did hve a disadvantage as the pool area was noisy right up until 10 pm.So despite the minor complaints, we really enjoyed the overall atmosphere and loved our suite, Coyote Camp, and the Lantanna Grill.",15-Apr-07,8,8,6,5,4,5,5,4,4,3.5,$184

We checked in late (around 9:30pm) on Sat., March 31st and received an updated suite in the North building.The main pool was a lot of fun. It was open from 8:00am-8:00pm during our visit. When you checked in you were given a wrist band and plenty of towels. We went down early both mornings and got a spot by the upper pool with the basketball net. People were reserving chairs but I always saw available chairs around.We enjoyed two great days at the pool. My children ages 8 10 met a lot of other children and enjoyed all of the activities they had going on. Some examples of the activities are: water balloon toss, water slide races, musical chairs and a watermelon eating contest just to name a few. I am not sure if they always have so many activities going on or if it is because it was the week before Easter (spring break) but my kids had a blast participating in them. Also, the college age guys/girls running the activities were super nice!! Winners even won prizes which were tickets for free smoothies at the snack bar. This was a good deal because if you paid for them they were $5 In the back of the gift shop there is a candy counter/icecream shop. Get your sodas there... a lot less expensive and a lot bigger.We ate lunch both days by the pool ordering from the snack/pool bar. The food was expensive and pretty good. We know what resort prices are and were not surprised. Unfortunately we did not get to eat at Hole in the Wall restaurant (my daughter became sick on the trip) We did order pizza from Streets of New York which delivered to the resort and was excellent. The day we left we had lunch at Aunt Chilad's which is in walking distance and is VERY good mexican.We thought the rooms were very clean and well furnished. The beds were very comfortable. We did not have any noise issues.

Plenty of room and privacy for two adults and two 14-year-olds. It's a perfect resort for those with children or teens because there are so many pools and activities, especially the golf. I was worried that we should have gone to the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs, but after a visit there for lunch we all agreed that Squaw Peak was superior for our needs.The food is a bit pricey, but that's typical of a resort.

We had a very nice room with a day room and a bedroom and a balcony. We had direct access to the cliffs right off of our floor. Room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The ground are very nice and spread out. There are shuttles that can take you all over the resort if you do not want to walk.

The family pool looked nice and there was a lot for the kids to do including a water slide. There are also a number of smaller pools all over the resort. The fitness center was nice I was however very annoyed that is was a ten dollar a day charge to use the fitness center.We only ate breakfast at the resort it was not to bad.

I will say that, within 10 minutes, our 2 year old's socks were literally black from the carpet - and although someone was sent up immediately to clean them, it still didn't do the job....so we wore our shoes at all times! Unfortunate that our 9 month old couldn't crawl on the floor though! I will say that customer service was very good...anytime we called with a request, someone was there within 5-10 minutes. We did request a refrigerator and crib (pack 'n' play is what is supplied) and both were in our room within 10 minutes of our arrival, and at no extra charge.

hotel_118,hotel_9454,"No fun at the Hilton! When I booked this reservation through a phone number listed on the hotel website, I SPECIFICALLY asked the reservationist to check the Ranch pool hours because we were arriving late, and would only book this hotel if the Ranch would be open for a couple hours after we arrived. Was told that it would be open until 7:00 pm. When we arrived at 4:00 pm, I asked the bellman to verify the Ranch hours, he also said it would be open until 7:00 pm. Well guess what? After rushing to check in, rushing to our room to change, running to the Ranch using a map that the bellman gave us so we wouldn't get lost on this vast property, the RANCH WAS CLOSED!! We were very disappointed (especially my 12 year old son whom I booked this for). I complained to the front desk manager, who told me that the Hilton is not responsible for the information that is given by the reservation agents since they are not on site!!! When I asked about the bellman's lack of correct information, the manager said that he would talk to him. What a joke!! Besides the issue with the Ranch, this facility is very old and is in serious need of updating. The regular pool area with the swim up bar (which we went to after we could not get into the Ranch) was cold; the jacuzzi jets did not work and the jacuzzi water was colder than the pool; and the pool attendant did not speak English and was unwilling to find someone to help us. Also, there were numerous breakfast trays sitting on the walkways that led to our room; and there is a huge gap between the walkways and the stair railings which could be extremely dangerous for a young child. On a positive note, the inside of the room was updated, clean and a good size. Everything in the room was operational and well maintained. The beds, though, were too soft for my liking. Be sure to ask for the newly renovated area when booking ( I would hate to see the unrenovated rooms)!All in all, a very disappointing experience at the Hilton. We will not book this hotel again. For a real treat, the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess is fabulous - would have been well worth the extra $100 for a room.",20-Mar-07,5,5,2,5,3,3,2,2,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_3335,a bit worn around the edges We had been to Phoenix several times before and had always stayed in Scottsdale .. Since we had our teenage son with us we decided to stay here because of the water park. The water park is indeed great and makes staying here worthwhile when everything is working which is not always the case. Like all Hilton properties in AZ the service here is poor. I had to call the manger one day to get the water slide turned on. Except for the concierge do not expect much service here. Based on my reading of this site I insisted on a renovated room. You should do the same. Our suite was spacious and spotless and gave us 2 separate rooms with 2 TVs to make everyone happy. The location in North Phoenix is a drawback and not a plus. Scottsdale 30 minutes away has much more to offer. The place could use a face lift. Stay here if the rate is good and you have kids. The kids will have a good tiime and then you will too.,17-Mar-07,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184

Very comfortable bed and good water pressure in shower. Pool and water park are very nice and would be fun for kids of all ages. Location is convenient for golf, shopping or business in Scottsdale area.Draw-backs: 1) Service is a bit spotty (e.g., dirty dishes from room service sat in hallway all day); 2) Slow and non-attentive check-in staff; 3) Sprawling nature of complex can be inconvenient and makes for long walks; 4) Very poor cell phone coverage through-out facility.",14-Mar-07,3,3,4,6,5,4,3,4,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_6328,"Room to Roam at accomodating Resort We chose this property based on the Hilton brand name, plus the casitas were enticing as reviews sounded as if they offered much more square footage than the average hotel room (which they do). The reason for my trip was the annual getaway with the girlfriends.Upon arrival, I was checked in promptly and driven by golf cart to my casita. The property is expansive and a huge plus is the willingness of the bell staff to show up w/ a golf cart to transport guests from place to place. In fact, I arrived in Phoenix in the a.m. and my friends, who rented the car, didn't join me until later in the day. The bell staff actually drove me by van to the local Walgreen's and drove me back when I completed my shopping.I will say that my original casita was a bit shabby...carpet worn and frayed, smelled musty and there was no dresser or proper closet in the bedroom. I had booked the casita based on the hotel's in-house reservation agent's description and it never occured to me to ask, is there a dresser and a traditional closet in the bedroom? I immediately called the front desk and I must say that the manager was MOST ACCOMODATING and not only changed my casita to a much nicer location, but offered an upgrade of an additional adjoining bedroom. Suffice it to say, the three of us were most comfortable during our stay w/ the two bedrooms. I found out later that the casitas are due for renovation next month (April '07). I'm glad I brought to the manager's attention the shabbiness of the first casita, especially because we were paying seasonal rates. It was nice reflection on the property that the manager did the right thing to accomodate guests.The property was beautiful and very well maintained. It was a bit cold to swim but the water park is great and I would highly recommend this property for vacationing families, singles and business travelers. There is a Convention Center attached and the property was filled to capacity, but one never had the perception that it was packed due to the fact that the property is so spread out. The onsite restaurants (only two) are well-staffed and the food is very good which is just below great. The room service crew erred quite a few times during our stay which was disappointing but they always strived to correct the problem. Also a DVD player was delivered w/o the remote, so a new one was delivered the next day and there was no charge. Although mistakes were made (shabby first room, room service omissions, DVD player w/o remote), EVERY EFFORT was made to correct the problem so as to make the customer happy. A final comment is the workout/spa facilities. The workout room is fantastic and has long hours of operation. The spa has very delightful technicians and the services were all quite satisfactory but it is definitely NOT A SPA. It is a beauty parlor w/ a few private rooms and a few showers. There is one chaise lounge in the ladies room that faces a wall and a dusty silk plant. In my opinion, any facility that calls itself a spa should at least have a relaxation room w/ a few sofas or lounge chairs. Again, the technicians delivered their services beautifully, but for the prices charged, this customer wants to bask in a true spa atmosphere before, during and after treatment!!I would recommend staying here, but don't expect a top notch, well-appointed room or spa even if you are paying $300+ per night. All employees and managers were exceptionally friendly and helpful (except one front desk clerk who asked, what do you want me to do? when we called because there was no remote w/ our dvd player)!I will consider staying here again as it is conveniently located near the airport, highways, restaurants and shopping, yet it feels a bit secluded due to the beautiful terrain and mountainous backdrop. Stay here with confidence as long as you have a tolerant personality and are not afraid to insist upon proper service!",8-Mar-07,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_6925,"Amazing Pool Area We stayed in one of the property's casitas twice in the last month, so this is a review of that particular type of room. The casitas are large and have a private carport and private entry. They have lots of room and would be great for families. The downstairs had a dining table, 2 sofas, t.v., wet bar and small refrigerator with 1/2 bath. Upstairs is the main bedroom with full bath and bed. The decor in the casitas was a bit run down, with really old burgundy carpet, very outdated bathroom fixtures, and furniture in desperate need of reupholstering. I think with some simple remodeling updates, this could be a first-rate property. One of our casitas had a nice large balcony off the main bedroom, while the other had a huge sundeck right off the second floor. The sundeck had a full sized table with 4 chairs and an umbrella and 2 lounge chairs! Awesome for soaking in the Arizona sun. One casita overlooked a private pool, which was so much fun to step right outside and hit the water. This is a super resort for kids! The main swimming pool area is amazing! The Hole-in-the-Wall River Ranch has a huge lazy river, waterfalls, mini golf, a Western themed town and a gorgeous outdoor patio with a firepit and smores at night.

hotel_118,hotel_1304,"Nothing Special Here I stayed at the Hilton Squaw Peak for a conference. As an earlier reviewer said, the bed is extremely comfortable; however, the property itself is a little rundown...missing roof tiles, tired carpet, that kind of thing. My room was on the fourth floor of one of the main buildings, and to get there you ride one elevator--by that I mean there is no service elevator, so half the time you're trying to negotiate around giagantic serivce carts or other maintenance equipment. Very strange. The part of the hotel I stayed in is very reminiscent of a Super 8, or other cheap motels with outdoor walkways--nothing special and certainly not resort-y. I do not know what the conference planners where thinking when they booked this spot; it's clearly a place for families with little kids, and it's minutes from...nowhere. Not my thing. I asked that the toilet in my room be fixed: it ran all the time. It was fixed so that it dripped all the time. Both were equally annoying and sleep-depriving. My room was very small--European small--and was dark, dark, dark. The trash cans are inadequate, and there is not one at the desk--although again this is not a hotel for business travelers.

hotel_118,hotel_2776,"My boys LOVED this place We just returned from a 4-day stay here and my kids want to move to Phoenix. There's a lot to recommend this Hilton, the water features in particular. My boys (ages 8 and 4) played mini golf in the putting green that surrounds the pool for hours. I could even let them wander off and do it together without supervision. That's a huge plus. The Coyote Club was very, very good. A really nice, large facility with clearly devoted staff and fun art projects and other endeavors (including a hunt for arrowheads that the staff had taken the time to scatter in the mountainous hills ahead of time). A couple recommendations if you go: be aware that the casitas, while two floors, have no doors at all closing the upstairs from the downstairs. So if you want to have any private time with your spouse, your kids will be well within earshot. I think I might have preferred to have stayed in a large room in the main hotel for this reason. I read another review about lackluster maintenance here and we had a problem with a clogged heating filter that banged all night long when our neighbor's heat/AC ran (every 10 minutes). But, to the Hilton's credit, they were very apologetic and made the appropriate compensation to us when I reported it. What else? I had a superb tennis lesson from Paul Dean, the tennis pro. The Saturday yoga class was also good. The spa services we had were good, but not excellent. If you really like spa treatments, I would recommend driving to one of the more upscale resorts (the Biltmore or the Phoenician) for those. Speaking of which, we had lunch poolside at the Biltmore and then played checkers on the lawn with the oversize pieces. A beautiful, historical place worth seeing. A don't miss local eatery is Chelsea's Kitchen; for a truly romantic dinner, try Lon's. Our boys loved Rawhide, a Western theme place 35 miles from the hotel.",27-Feb-07,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184

We were looking forward to time at the River Ranch, and what little we had (due to weather and naps) was really nice. In addition our room was nicely appointed and appeared to be newly renovated. Unfortunately, that's where the good things end. Overall, the hotel is a bit run down and hardly anything is included in the price of stay. All eating on property was expensive - $16 for the breakfast buffet at the Lantana Grill! Our one meal at the Hole in the Wall was not good at all. The service was terrible, even with plenty of open seating. The live music was fun for the kids though. And finally, my biggest gripe of all has to do with the spa. To call it a spa is ridiculous! It was a run down athletic club with what appeared to be a 1960's beauty parlor attached. My scrub and massage where terrible - and mainly do to the ambience - or lack thereof. Not worth one penny, especially if you have EVER had a massage or treatment at any place even slightly better. Re-vamp, Re-vamp, Re-vamp! We'll probably not be going back.

It was fine, although I think that the earlier advice I found on this web site to request a room in the newer portion of the hotel was key. It's a sprawling, resort-style hotel; not at all like the single building versions of Hiltons to which we're accustomed to from the rest of the country. The room was clean, the top floor of our location (We stayed in the north building) was quiet. Maintenance could stand to be a bit better here, as the shower drain ran very slowly and the toilet never stopped running.

WE were really excited when they assigned us a condo type room with a covered parking space. WEll, when we drove back to our room, which was a duplex, with one more larger room below us, we were upset because all of the four parking spots were taken, by who , I don't know. SO we parked on the street. This was fine. So let me get to the horrible part. When we were ready for bed, at about 10pm, we heard very very loud rap music apparently coming from the room below us. I called the front desk once and they called the other room and the music stopped. OKAY fine, right ? NO WAY. At about 12am we were awoken to very very loud music and a bunch of kids screeming HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I called front desk, they sent out security and the music stopped. ABout 20 min later, the music started again. AND SERIOUSLy, it seemed like our walls were paper thin. We could hear these kids cussing and yelling and we even smelled pot. I was SO furious by this point, its 2am now, I called front desk and asked for another room. THEY REFUSED and said they would call security again. Security did nothing but made all the kids leave the room. SO now the kids are standing outside our window cursing and breaking bottles. WAS this the HILTON OR WHAT?? I called the front desk yet again and demand a new room or to call the police. They still did NOTHING. Let me tell you I was even afraid to go outside to check on my car. Well, I called and got the managers name, obviously an inexperienced kid, and in the morning when I spoke to the manager, he again did nothing. OH wait, he took $20 off our BILL I WAS SO FURIOUS!! I will absolutely never ever stay here again. I cannot believe a hilton would allow this. ANd I didn't even mention that these kids came back in the morning about 6:30 am and began slamming doors.

The only difference was the Hilton beds (which were very comfortable) and the new tile on the bathroom floor. Our chair was ripped, old furniture, old carpeting, they even took out the refridgerators and left an empty hole.

The river wasn't dirty at all while we were there.We ate dinner and breakfast at the hole in the wall restaurant (I think that's what it was called) and it was excellent food and service. Overall a fantastic short break, to recover from Vegas and the Grand Canyon. Only wish we could have stayed longer!",16-Oct-06,7,7,6,6,5,6,6,6,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_9242,"Just what the Dr. ordered! We ended up choosing this resort thanks to the reviews on tripadvisor.com and were NOT disappointed! My girlfriend and I stayed in this fine resort for 4 days in early Oct. We found most of the reviews to be very true and accurate. Rather than sharing useless details about our stay, I will instead provide you with suggestions on how you can enjoy your stay to the fullest!. Hopefully these suggestions will make your trip as successful as ours. #1 - Request a remodeled room upon making your reservation. The remodeled rooms contain new everything! Our room was AWESOME! We checked out some rooms that had not yet been remodeled, at the same price, and were so thankful that we had made this request (thanks to other reviews on tripadvisor.com). #2 - Request a fridge upon checking in. This cost us nothing and proved so nice to have. #3 - Take advantage of the free shuttle system. Upon request, the bell desk granted us free shuttles to the Fashion mall and the Squaw Peak Summit. They were EXTREMELY courteous and very informative. Assuming you are at all adventurous and enjoy the outdoors, I cannot say enough good things about the Squaw Peak Summit climb. 1.5 miles, 1200 feet up, and so very very beautiful! The other climbers are VERY friendly and the view is to die for. Be sure to bring your camera and plenty of water! #4 - Eat at Hole In The Wall! The food is fantastic, VERY reasonable, and the service is professional and timely. We ate there each day. Dominic was our waiter and VERY friendly! #5 - Take advantage of the concierge. We knew very little about the area that we were in along with the attractions that were nearby. They are VERY helpful and will provide you with an array of attractions, availability, prices, recommendations, etc. #6 - Lastly - plan on making a trip to the Walgreens or any local grocery store on the first day. The water in the room is a complete rip off ($6 a bottle) and the drinks at the pool ($9 for a weak mixed drink) were about the only negatives that we could come up with. After the first day we stocked up on water and bought some liquor at the grocery store in order to make this trip more affordable and enjoyable. I would/have HIGHLY recommend this resort too all of my friends and family. I simply hope that you enjoy your trip just as much as we enjoyed ours!",8-Oct-06,10,10,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_4804,"Family Friendly Nice resort, clean, friendly staff. We stayed in a Suite in the North Tower. They originally put us in the South Tower but we asked for the North Tower since part of the South Tower is under construction. The pool areas were nice. We spent time in the North Tower pool, as well as the main pool. At the main pool service wasn't that great, you had to go up to the bar if you wanted anything. At the North Tower the service was better.The Hole in the Wall restaurant was a surprise. The food was good and reasonable. But if you are looking for other restaurants that are close by be sure to try Houston's off of Camelback Rd. and The Fish Market. Both are kid friendly.Overall, we had a pleasant visit and would stay here again.",15-Sep-06,10,8,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_4298,"Great Family Vacation Spot Our family of 5 stayed at this resort for 5 nights commencing August 25, 2006. We were located in a two storey, 2 bedroom Casita unit close to the River Ranch. Very convienient. We were not disturbed by the construction which was ongoing nearby, and in fact, we were impressed by how sound proof the unit seemed to be. The resort was great for the kids , swimming, waterslides and the lazy river. The cost of refreshments and food poolside was on the high side - and certainly adds up with thirsty and hungry children. The service we received was great and we encountered no problems either at check in or check out. We enjoyed the separate pool near the Casitas for a break from the river ranch as well as for use after the river ranch closed. The resort was exactly what we were looking for!",3-Sep-06,7,6,5,5,5,4,6,5,4,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_8100,Major construction There was a major construction going on in the building were they put us. Very dissapointing especially since this was not mentioned at all on either their website or during check-in. On Sunday at 7.30am we were woken up by the noise of a chisel and hammer! Very inconsiderate and cheap for a hotel in this league. I called the front desk to comment on this and all I got was that they would notify the supervisor on Monday. Never heard back from them. We will not stay at this place again.,24-Aug-06,8,6,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_6710,"Great family resort This was our third year staying at the Hilton Squaw Peak. We stayed for five days and were able to get a complimentary upgrade (w/our Hilton rewards points) to a one bedroom (2 story) casita, which is perfect for families with 2 or more children. The River Ranch is wonderful for kids and adults alike.....the slower paced lazy river is for those that just want to float in inner tubes and the waterslide is for the kids or adults that want to go faster. This time of year is usually hotter in AZ, thus the water park is even more relaxing. They have an extremely accomodating staff, very friendly and helpful, we just had to watch that our bill was accurate (quite a bit of accidental over-charges). The Hole in the Wall restaurant is great. My kids love ordering the rattlesnake ($18) dinner and you can roast s'mores right at your table ($10). I recommend their Arizona style bloody mary's to drink, served with olives, pepperocini's. and extra spice...very tasty. We took the free shuttle service up to their sister resort (Tapatio Cliffs) about 10-15 min up the mtn, and enjoyed the pools there one day. Tapatio Cliffs seemed a bit more upscale than Squaw Peak..much more adult only pools, nice cushions on the pool chairs, etc., but my kids and I had fun swimming and relaxing by their lagoon style pools as well. They also have an enclosed water slide at the cliffs .....both places are nice resorts, and its convenient to be be able to shuttle between them. Coyote Camp is a great place to drop off your kids for desert- themed arts/crafts/activities, etc (ages 5-12 yrs) and it costs about $10 per hr per child.....worth it in my opinion. My daughter, now 10 yrs, has been going to Coyote Camp 3 yrs in a row , and this one of her favorite things to do at the resort. The staff at Coyote Camp is always warm, welcoming and accomodating to my kids and some of the staff have been there 15 years. They love what they do.We also visited the Phoenix Science Center in downtown Phoenix and stayed 3-4 hours.....I highly recommend it....we ate a lite lunch at the Victorian Tea House, next door to the Science Center afterwards..and that also is a good place to eat, they even have a children's menu.You can spend some $$ is you order poolside, each non-alcoholic drink is $2.50 for soda/tea and you pay by the glass/cup...for instance, each time I wanted a glass of iced tea, I paid for it, no free refills, so that can definitely add up, but it is convenient to sit by the pool and have someone bring you drinks/food, etc.Otherwise, great trip all around, and summer is the best time to go, because the rates are so cheap...we definitely recommend the Hilton Squaw Peak or Tapatio Cliffs to anyone, especially families.",19-Aug-06,10,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_10101,"great time Went for 2 nights with our two girls, ages 9 and 11. The room was very comfortable (NorthPointe), we all loved the pool complex and enjoyed the brunch at the Lantana grill. Overall we were very happy with our choice to stay there.Our only issue was the slow speed of the lazy river (it was asleep!) but this allowed us to play while going around.

hotel_118,hotel_3638,"Familes- Think Twice!!! What a let down. Not even for $99 did I feel like I got a good deal. This property is dated and one stop short of dirty. It is huge and poorly laid out -- you will walk a lot, and it is unlikely you will park near your room. They charge you for everything and provide little: you pay for internet, local calls, a pack  play -- and of course there is no fridge or microwave or continental breakfast like a HI Express et al. The water park is OK, but unless you can say to yourself 1. this is the most important part of my stay, and 2. I don't mind if it is marginal/out of date (though, the kids loved it to be fair) -- at best, then this is the place for you. Service was wretched: booked a non-smoking, called ahead to ensure that we had one, and of course we were put in smoking. The elevator was broken for the whole stay. The soda machine ate our money. It was a comedy of errors. The Marriott Desert Ridge is the place.

hotel_118,hotel_3350,"River Ranch is great, Hotel needs a lot of help Having just returned from the Hilton Squaw Peak, I must say that this hotel has major problems. Nowehere on the website does it indicaqte that the property is undergoing major renovations, but it is. We traveled with 4 other families. Two of the rooms had air conditioner problems, requiring a move. The moves took at least an hour to accomplish, and, one move required the guests to move their own luggage, as the bellman refused to move the bags, after being asked not to drag the ladies' dress on the ground. We were told that the bell station moves about 40 rooms a day due to the construction, and problems with the rooms. Half the hotel is closed, for construction, leaving only two ice machines an entire wing. This meant that there was hardly any ice ever available. The elevator broke during our stay. Since there was only one elevator in the south wing, if you wanted to get to and from your room, you had to walk.The pool is very nice, and the kids enjoyed it. The south pool was closed, and we did not get to the north pool. A fire, or what was described as an event, in lanatanna caused the only restaurant to be the hole in the wall.Overall, the service in the hotel is poor. The river ranch is great, but, the hotel itself does not seem to be Hilton quality. More like Comfort Inn quality.",8-Aug-06,6,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_5336,Kids and Water go together! This place was fun. I loved the lazy river. Great place to relax. The casita was showing signs of getting older though. I loved the bathroom vanity though with double sinks. We had a balcony on our casita to sit outside at night. The drinks at the pool were excellent. It was crowded the weekend we stayed so lines were long at the bar. The kids loved the movie in the water. Hotel staff were excellent as well. I would stay again during summer months only because the water was the reason we were there!,1-Aug-06,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7662,"Great Family Atmosphere We stayed at this resort for for three days in July. We live in the Phoenix area and took advantage of the reasonable summer rates. Our family of four stayed in a Cassita. This is a two story townhouse suite. There was plenty of room for everyone. The suites come with one or two bedrooms upstairs and an upstairs bathroom. Downstairs,there is a pull out couch , kitchen with a sink, fridge and microwave. The hotel will supply a cot if additional bedding is needed. This resort also has motel room suites. Our two boys, ages 11 and 13 really enjoyed themselves here. There was plenty to do at the western themed pool areasuch as tubing on the lazy river, basketball at the sport pool or miniature golfing. Ask for the value pack to save money on the miniature golfing and fitness club .There was also a Saturday night movie at the pool area for the younger kiddies. They might want to set up a PG-13 movie at the sport pool area. This is an older resort that is kept up pretty well. The pool area needs some kind of pebbletec path to avoid burning your feet and there wasn't a safe in our suite. This can be a big problem when the whole family goes out to the pool. The resort is very close to the Camelback area where there are additional places to dine. Fashion Square mall is down the street as well. We had a great time!",31-Jul-06,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7123,"Disappointed Let me first say I am not a particularly hard to please person. But I join Tripadvisor just to write a review about my familys recent stay here. Started out w/ our room (and many others) not being ready on time, and their check-in time is 4PM. After having to wait twice in a long line regaridng the status of our room we finally got our keys at 5:15pm. They front desk personnel were rude and offer no apology for the wait. If you have little kids, imagine just having to wait around for over an hour. Also, their parking situation is horrible. We had to park off property to get a spot. The lazy river is dirty and overall the pool area is overrated. The food is average at best and way overpriced. I am a local in the Phoenix area, and we will never stay at the Pointe Squaw Peak again... there are much nicer resorts in town at similar prices in the summer. I say pass and go somewhere like the Biltmore or Westin Keirland.",28-Jul-06,3,1,3,4,4,4,2,4,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_3290,"Great for kids We are a family of two adults and four children (aged between 5  13). We stayed 2 nights a couple of weeks ago as a stop-off between San Diego and the Grand Canyon. We booked a casita and were pleased to note that it was very close to the River Ranch pool complex. The casita was clean and the beds were comfortable (even the sofa bed) although I felt that the room could do with brightening up a bit. After settling in, we headed for the pool complex, which was quieter than we expected. We all enjoyed the lazy river and the sport pool. We chose to bring our own food for breakfast, to keep costs down, and were back at the pool at 8am the next morning as it opened. Again, we had a great time, but had to retreat to the shade and cool of the casita for an hour at lunchtime. We found the young pool area staff to be helpful, the ice cold water coolers a bonus and the gift shops reasonably priced. My son enjoyed the mini golf and we discovered by chance on the second day that we were entitled to free golf and half price ice cream as we apparently were on the Value Package. It would have been nice to have been told this upon arrival. Be aware that if you are in the hotel rooms in the courtyard near the other pools, these do not close until 11pm. When we were there, a group of teenagers seemed to be occupying it. Not causing trouble, but being loud. If you have young children, this could disrupt an early night and we were therefore pleased that we were out in a casita. For a couple of days by the pool, it was ideal for us.",24-Jul-06,2,2,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,3.5,$184

We stayed for 10 days and could have easily stayed another 10 days. The staff was very friendly and helped in every way. The pools were very nice and stayed open very late considering it was very hot.The tombstone shootout was excellent, the kids love it. Also the movie night was a big hit, with everyone. The bar staff at the pool side was very polite and friendly, as was every one.. We loved the lazy river, could have stayed there all day..

hotel_118,hotel_9197,"Enjoyed our stay We stayed at Squaw Peak July 7-July 9, 2006. Check in was friendly, bell hop very personable and helpful. We stayed in a King Bed Suite. The room was very nice. Bed linens very nice, towels and spa products good quality, bathroom immaculately clean, bed verrrry comfortable. A small kitchenette with mini-bar and sink and coffee maker. The couch was very uncomfortable to sit on, although my son slept fine when it was pulled out. Limited cable channels on the tv, but we rented still-in-theater movies for $10.99. The grounds are well maintained and we didn't see any roaches. For people who aren't used to the south, these are Palmetto bugs. They are big and ugly, but harmless. Southern states spray continuously to keep them at bay. So, please don't let seeing one or some scare you out of a good time. The resort itself is huge, some areas noisier than others. The River Ranch was nice we enjoyed the Lazy River until it got crowded. Go early and grab a chair with an umbrella, leave your stuff there to save your seat. It gets pretty crowded. They do have poolside service and there are a couple of places to get food. Plenty of fresh towels and coolers with cold water to drink. We didn't stay long, because we didn't get there early enough for a good chair. Make sure you leave your shoes on when you walk around, we made the mistake of heading off to the Lazy River without ours on and I nearly burnt my feet off!! Ha ha.. hot hot hot. There are cubbies at the top to leave your flip flops, I found that out a little too late. Saturday nights they close at 6:15-7:30 to set up for Dive In Movie night where they show PG movies poolside. Pretty cool for the kiddies. Admission is always free to guests..also pretty cool. The location of the Resort is very convenient for day trips, about 5 hours to Grand Canyon, Scottsdale is close to check out shopping and art shops. The views are nice, plenty of restaurants of all kinds nearby. I have to give a rave review for Consierge Dave. He is awesome. He is friendly and insightful, he knows everything about everywhere and is quick to figure out your every needs, likes and dislikes. So, if you ever stay there, make sure you tell him that a Trip Advisor member sent you to him with rave reviews. He's a professional all the way.",13-Jul-06,6,3,5,6,1,5,1,4,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_10026,"No thanks I decided to take my husband  children here as a relaxing Fathers day treat, not sure I should have wasted my money.Check in was adequate but not what I'd have expected from the Hilton, the guy at reception was just doing his job no friendly niceities, no chit chat no information other than what was on the check in papers.We got taken to our room by a golf cart, which the boys enjoyed and were pointed in the right direction for the river ranch, very convieniently behind our room.Our bags were carried in and the guy was very friendly with all the right things to say,nice chit chat and pleasanteries.The room itself was ok, nice sitting area and separate bedroom.Decor has seen better days though. Wonderfully soft,luxurios beds with plenty of squishy pillows.AC worked perfect.The TINY LITTLE outside area I can't call it a patio wasn't big enough to swing a cat in and looked straight out onto the car park, good only for keeping a check on the van!We kept the shades pulled to try  hide it, and pretend it wasn't really there.River ranch was fine,the boys loved it. Too busy for me and too many tweenagers pushing in front of my little ones. Filling up the water coolers occassionally wouldn't kill anyone! We spent more time at the quieter pool within the courtyard off the lobby which was less crowded and much more relaxed.We had dinner at the hole in the wall,which was over priced and not worth it.The server couldn't wait to finish with our table of 4 so she could get on to the party of 12 who walked through the door, obviously they were going to tip more than us, and they did as I left a pitance for her lousy,inatentive service!We had breakfast at the Lantana grill and it was really nice, fresh fruit,cereals,pastries,eggs,bacon etc. and they had an offer on that ment the boys ate free with our adult meals.This wasn't mentioned to us when we checked in, we were told about it when we sat down.All in all I shouldn't have wasted my money, and it wasn't cheap to stay here, but the boys enjoyed the river ranch.Would I stay here again- NO WAY :(",7-Jul-06,12,3,2,4,1,5,1,4,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_9752,"Nice Place Stayed with my wife and two children (3.5 and 1.5 yrs) at the Pointe from 20-22 June as a last minute change from a hotel in Sedona due to the recent Oak Creek Canyon fires. Resort was available and inexpensive as we needed a place to stay before moving into another resort in Scottsdale.Resort located in midst of city, surrounded by heavy traffic roads, etc, though we could not hear any road noise due to the landscaping and how the rooms faced inward to a pool area. Room had a separate two queen bed bedroom, TV, bureau, credenza and closet - no security safe though. Odd shape of room led to the use of a pocket door instead of a regular door, plus one bed partially blocked the door exit. Otherwise, the bedroom was fine. Patio which was a sliding door off the bedroom looked out into the pool and the neighboring hallway. Just enough room for two chairs - useful only to dry your swim suit. Bathroom split with toilet, tub/shower in one room and sink/countertop in an open area next to the bedroom. Living room had a sofa, chair, chair/desk, TV stand, mini-bar fridge/counter with coffee maker. Minibar was stocked with usual minibar overpriced drinks/snacks. We asked for a refrigerator and microwave which was delivered later in the day. Furniture looked fine, but the carpet was a bit dated. Room was fine, though worn.Parking was far from the room and no easy path to get the luggage to the room. Initial day the elevator was broken, requiring lugging everything to the second floor by hand. By 2nd day, elevator was functional. Grounds were well maintained and manicured greenery.Best asset of the Pointe was the water park (passes for each hotel guest) and the quieter smaller pools in two of the hotel complexes. Hotel pools were well maintained, plenty of towels, chairs, cleaned pool, kiddie pool, whirlpool, chilled water cooler/cups. Water park was typical - lazy river, sports pool - volleyball, regular pool with water falls. Too busy for our needs, so we visited only once to see what was offered. Adjacent grill provided food. Food was typical grill food with children's menu. Room service was offered, though we did not partake.All, in all the stay was slightly above average. Did not see any cockroaches or other bugs. Place was clean, though a bit dated and worn. Hotel lobby was cheerful, staff friendly and helpful. Place was trying hard to make people happy. Would stay again.

hotel_118,hotel_7131,"Great customer service... If you are looking for a clean and spacious hotel that is conveniently located,and you enjoy a family friendly environment with exceptional service, this hotel may be for you. Although lacking the initial wow factor that I expected, I thought that The Hilton provided amazing service. The concierge was friendly and extremely helpful, our room was always clean, the pool attendants were very welcoming, and room service was quick and delicious. With any hotel, there were a few things that I wished were a bit different. The sitting room was dark, even with all three lamps on, the air conditioning was a little loud and the sink/mirror were separate from the shower/toilet. The light switch to the bathroom was located outside of the bathroom door. So, for those of you traveling with practical jokers, they will have a great time at your expense! Nothing earth shattering, just food for thought. Now, back to the fun stuff...the hotel offers many different pools to accomodate people of all ages, and they even had a movie night! Our courtyard pool closed earlier than posted, so you may want to check the hours. The hotel is conveniently located for sight seeing. Take time to drive around and look at the mountains, they are gorgeous! Scottsdale/Phoenix has wonderful restaurants . NY pizza delivers to the hotel and was fast and delicious, Charlestons and Black Angus are casual but very nice, and have wonderful food and excellent service. Bahama Breeze has good food in a fun environment, and also had outstanding service. Kierland Commons and Desert Ridge shopping centers offer fun shopping, and are nice areas even if you are only window shopping. Plenty of antique shops and golfing opportunities abound. Antique shoppers traveling with families beware: there is one town in particular that is well known for it's antique shops. They have a beautiful brochure, which is extremely misleading. Once you see the gang graffiti, turn around, it does not get much better. It is obvious that the town is trying to clean things up, because the actual downtown area is being renovated and looks quite lovely. The surrounding area...not so lovely, and it isn't worth the risk. Although I feel a little guilty for indirectly ratting them out, I feel a deeper loyalty to innocent families who may get into harms way. Don't miss the Desert Botanical Garden, which is beautiful and very peaceful. There are also plenty of little squirrels and quail to amuse everyone. Crackerjax offers miniature golfing, go-carts and an arcade. Although not entirely perfect, the Hilton offers a comfortable environment for the whole family, and near-perfect service. They have great rates right now, so I would definetely give them a try.",4-Jul-06,4,4,4,3,1,4,1,6,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_9854,"Stay Away...Terrible Hotel We were at this hotel on June 19 and June 28, 2006.June 19 stay:We arrived at the hotel at about 8:30 p.m. and with 3 kids they were ready to get in the pool and relax after a long day of traveling. Upon check in we were not greeted just checked in. We were given a key and led to the appropriate parking lot for our building and pointed in the direction of our room. We carried our own luggage down a dark hallway to the last room. The room was ok but not worth the price we paid. The smoke detector was hanging from the wall with wires hanging from the wall, we were not sure if it worked or not?? With that said we quickly changed and headed to the pool. It took us a good 10 minutes to find the pool. Once we found it we noticed 3 families leaving the ares with their children. A few minutes later I realized why they were leaving. There were 3 young adults clearly drunk and acting very loud and obnoxious. They were drinking and some very inappropriate behavior between the famale and male was happening in the jacuzzi area. I told my kids to stay at our end of the pool since they really wanted to swim. A few minutes later the young males climed on top of the pool bar's roof and started jumping into the pool. I finally decided to call the front desk and was assurred they would send security. 10 minutes later I called again because no security personnel ever came to the pool area. Another 10 minutes and 6 security personnel officers arrived. The young adults were bad mouthing the security and refusing to get out of the pool. It turns out that they were not even guests at the hotel. A little later 2 of the families that left earlier returned with their kids to swim in the pool. Where were those security officers and why were they not wlking the grounds. The next morning we left the grounds to have breakfast in town not realizing that the hotel offered children eat free with the purchase of an adults meal. Thats because we were not told anything upon check in, no information about the hotel, no information about the specials, and no map or information about their Hole in the Wall water park. I complained about all of the above to Guest Relations and was told I would hear from the General Manager of the Hotel. I only received a call from the Head of Security explaining that the young adults were escorted off the hotel grounds, which was information I already knew. That was the only response I received and the only issue I addressed. I called the Guest Relations again to inform them that I had not heard a response from the Hotel's General Manager and was told that I received a call from the Head of Security addressing my concerns. I told Customer Relations this was not true and filed another complaint. Which led to our discounted stay on June 28, which was just as bad.We were offered a 50% discount to stay again. We were given a room facing the courtyard, seemed nice and as if they were attempting to make up for the bad service we previously experienced. We went to the pool and enjoyed a nice quiet time until we got into the ice cold jacuzzi and no one to help fix it. We went back to our room to take showers and questioned if the bathroom/room had been cleaned or cleaned and then used??? The bathroom had a used towel hanging on the back of the door and hair on the floor and in the shower on the tub and shower curtain. I was so angry at this point I just wanted to leave but it was 11:30. We got ready for bed and as my daughter pulled down the sheets to her bed she discovered hair strands between her sheets....she almost threw up and was on the verge of tears because she didn't want to sleep in it. The next morning I decided to take the kids to the Hole in the Wall Water Park attached to the hotel and discovered the mail pool was closed. After an hour or so I walked down to see if it was open. I saw bugs floating in the pool. These were roach type bugs that were huge. They were so big I had to ask if they were real or a childs toy. They were real. There were grounds keepers and maintance workers running around all morning so I didn't know what was going on. Now I know there are bugs everywhere but if they had sprayed I think they should of opened later or scooped the bugs out of the pool right away. I was scared to let my children in the pool because I didn't know if there was chemicals in there or what. The bugs were also floating in the lazy river......YUK! At this point I just wanted to run as fast as I could from this place. The water park staff was rude and no one there was helpful. I again called the Guest Relations to complain and was told that I would hear from the General Manager of the hotel. As of today July 4, I have not heard a word from anyone. I would stay as far away from this hotel as possible. You could get better service from any other hotel in the area for far less money.",4-Jul-06,8,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184

Probably the best night's sleep I have ever had while staying in a hotel. We ate two breakfasts on site at the Slim Pickens Restaurant. The first was a breakfast buffet on Sunday and it was exceptional. All you can eat for 9.99. Service was excellent. The second time we ate was during the week and breakfast cost more and was not very good. Service was not acceptable. We thought that our young waiter had quit during our meal.The propery was very well kept. The only problem was the pool area where we were located. Each area has its own pool. During the first few days of our stay, the pool was in disarray every morning. Towels were not picked up and food and beverage containers were still everywhere from the night before. About Wednesday, things changed and the pool area was spotless. Possibly the person in charge of the pool was on vacation at the beginning of the week. Another problem with the pool was a private company giving swimming lessons to small children. After a day of being in conferences, it would have been nice to just get into the pool, but that wasn't always possible. Last, there are no pool rules posted and children were throwing balls, diving into the pool (there was a no diving sign), and many just being obnoxious. No real parenting going on there. The same could be said for the Lazy River. Luckily I wasn't there for a relaxing vacation.While I would consider staying there again because the rooms and staff were so nice, probably I would look for another place.",20-Jun-06,15,14,5,6,1,5,1,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_8036,"Awsome place for kids and adults that are ""still kids"" !! We have custody of our 7 year old grandson and we found Squaw Peak on the Hilton website. We wanted a fun place to take him and this looked like it was it. After booking, I became concerned after reading some of the TripAdvisor reviews. Having stayed in a number of Hilton properties, I can tell you that if you have children, this is the place to go. The River Ranch has multiple pools, a long lazy river for use with pool-supplied inner tubes, a water slide, and a kiddie pool. Neat waterfall for kids and adults to play in. There is also a hot tub at the River Ranch. Food at the River Ranch outdoor bar is the same price as any pool resort-a little pricey, but not outrageuos. But there are plenty of water stations at the pool with large containers of free cold water and plenty of cups along side. The only aspect that bothered me is that through the week, it closed at 8 pm. I thought that too early-especially with the temp hitting 112 degrees...The Hole in the Wall restaurant at the River Ranch was good and the prices were very reasonable. We did not play the miniature golf only because it was too hot, but it looked fun. We stayed in a regular suite with 2 queen beds, and it was fine. Very comfortable bed. No, you could not put personal items in the fridge, but we bought a styro cooler down the street at Walgreens and kept it filled with ice from the ice machines located on every floor.If you are eating outside the resort, you will need a car. You can walk to Aunt Chiladas (good Mexican food-neat atmosphere- very reasonable prices-good margaritas -you can purchase your own shaker to take home!) Other than that, you will need to drive. Good choices are Claim Jumper (good prices- kid friendly-neat menu choices-to die for 6 layer chocolate cake..it is a 10 dollar dessert, but feeds a host of people!) Another fun place to take kids is the 5  Diner. (Juke box at every table, milk shakes served in the stainless shakers-terrific food real really reasonably priced..) Pizza was good and inexpensive at Streets of New York. We were only there for 4 days, so we did not go on any tours or day trips. But our grandson enjoyed the pools so much that it did not matter to us that we did not go anywhere else. After the pool closed at 8 pm, he could swim in our south-end pool complex. I thought the water was cloudy in the hotel complex pool, but he enjoyed it anyway. I was looking forward to using the hotel complex hot tub after the River Ranch closed, but the first night, it was ice cold! It was warm the remaining nights, though...We did check out the Hilton Tapatio Resort also in Phoenix. Again, if you have kids or are an adult that likes water play, stick to Squaw Peak! I did think the pricing for the Squaw Peak kids Coyote Camp was too high. But since our grandson was perfectly happy making friends in the River Ranch water area, we did not use the Camp. The River Ranch is open later on Fri and Sat nights-they show an outdoor kids movie on Sat nights. The kids can swim and watch a movie at the same time-that was kinda cool...It did bother me that there were no safes in the rooms-that needs attention!! And a 10 dollar a day charge for internet service was ridiculous-I would not and did not pay for that-even thought I took my wireless laptop with me. Sorry, but that should be free!!! The staff was friendly and they all took a few moments and chatted with our grandson whenever he wanted to show them his latest purchase from a gift shop or needed scotch tape or glue for something he was working on..(Much appreciated, staff!) And the lady at the 3rd floor kids concierge played a board game with him one hot afternoon-thanks! And the hotel concierge in the lobby really knew the area and what to recommend. He printed a map for us one night when we asked directions for an eatery. And they will print your boarding passes for you the day before you leave-that was a great help to us!I do think they need more handicapped parking. My husband requires handicapped parking, and it was always hard to find one available-especially during the weekend. But all in all, we had a really fun time just swimming, exploring the resort complex, trying out new restaurants-just spending some quality family time together. It was very relaxing and my grandson is ready to go again next year. Ditto for my husband and I !!",18-Jun-06,23,21,5,5,1,5,1,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_8031,"Nice property..... A group of friends  I stayed at the Pointe Hilton from 5/18/06 through 5/21/06. The purpose of the trip, besides to relax, was to visit friends  golf. Overall, the resort was very nice, however very big.....good luck getting around w/o a map. I've indicated Pro and Cons below:Pro:1) Great pool(s)! - The North  South buildings all had their own pools, with hot tubs  bars. The River Ranch was huge, with multiple tiered pools. The River, although slow, was very nice and pretty long. You basically ride a large inner-tube. The pool area is great for families with kids.2) General service - I thought the service was great, very helpful. 3) Nice rooms - The rooms were nice, not very upscaled. We stayed in the regular 1-bedroom suites, so I can't speak about the bigger units or Casitas.4) Easy check in/out. Be aware of the 4pm check-in though.5) Room service (meals) were good.Cons:1) Construction work on our floor....changing out locks. Not too much of an inconvenience, but a bit of a hassle getting new keys. The resort is starting to show alittle wear  tear, hence the need for constant fixes.2) Maid service had to be reminded to make-up rooms.3) The resort is a bit expensive for a Hilton, but many discounts (i.e. AAA, Entertainment) exist.4) This is a great family resort, however, given that my group had no kids tagging along, we got alittle tired of all little ones running around. If that's a problem, go elsewhere.Things to do:1) Sedona was a great day trip. I'll certainly make another trip there someday.2) Golfing - we played at the Sanctuary and the Arizona Biltmore. Both great courses! The Sanctuary is a VERY tight desert course, while the Biltmore is a traditional course. The temperture was brutal however, about 105 degrees!",22-May-06,18,15,4,5,1,5,1,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7900,"A Great Family Vacation Spot--During The Off-Season At Least We stayed at the Squaw Peak Resort for four nights during the week of 5/7/06. I typically to do a lot of research before we go on vacation, because elements of a vacation--like the quality of the hotel--can make or break the entire trip. I must admit that I was a bit nervous about reserving a room at the Squaw Peak Resort because there were some mixed on-line reviews. Some people reported poorly lit rooms. Others said the property was dated. One review said that it had those kind of people, though I'm not exactly sure what that meant.So, here is the scoop...This place is not a Four Seasons, nor is it the Phoenician. It, however, does not charge 5-Star resort rates either--we paid $161/night AAA rate for a true suite with a separate bedroom. With respect to quality of the accomodations, the Squaw Peak Resort is in line with an Embassy Suites hotel. The hotel caters to both conventioniers and famlies. This diversity is made possible because the hotel's River Ranch water park area (a very nice family-oriented swimming pool(s) recreation area) is separated from the hotel buldings by the parkng lot. For the most part, this separation keeps the families away from the business people, who have their own, less ornate pools in their respective hotel wings. Overall, the grounds are very pleasant, and the River Ranch area is very nice. The Lazy River, which is a swimming pool that allows you to float in an innertube around the property, is fun and highly relaxing. The photos I have seen of the Lazy River really don't do it justice as it is pretty expansive and the scenery is diverse too.The food in the pool area is solid and the service at The Hole In The Wall Restaurant borders on excellent. As a matter of fact, everyone at the hotel is very friendly and courteous. The hotel also has a great work-out area (available to guests for a small fee)--much better than the standard hotel gym--with an extensive weight room and a separate aerobics room. I did not try any services at the adjacent spa, but that looked decent too. Like all things in life, there are things to complain about. I noticed the first few days that a lot of the inevitable litter (drink cups, etc.) that people leave around the multiple swimming pools didn't get cleaned up by the hotel staff--This was epecially true of the Lazy River, where the same crushed can of beer lingered for days on a wall around one of the bends.A small complaint is that the hotel is not walking distance to anything in particular. As a result, you really need a car if you want a change of scenary. It is about a 15-25 minute drive to Scottsdale which has great shopping, dining, and people watching. The second item isn't so much a complaint as it is a concern...What would this place be like during spring break? We went during the low season, when most kids are in school, so the resort wasn't very crowded. But, the staff told me that during spring break, and during the summer when highly discounted rates are available, that the place is really hopping. The River Ranch is big, but not that big, so one's stay would probably be a lot less relaxing during those times. My bigger wonder, however, has to do with drinking age kids, as I could see a mix of college kids and little kids would be poor in a place that serves alcohol pool-side. Overall, the Squaw Peak Resort offers a great family value for the dollar. My six year-old thought it was on par with Maui and Disneyland as a vacation destination--pretty high praise. I would have to agree with her that it was a pretty special trip and we would definitely stay here again.",20-May-06,25,22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1095,"customer service was great After reading all 113 reviews, I was skeptical. Sometimes I wonder if these reviews help or hinder a trip. My family of 4 (2 girls 5 and 10) travelled with my parents to Phoenix for a 5 day vacation. My mother can be hard to please. She had a great time. Here are the positives and negatives. Every person we encountered at the hotel was friendly. The rooms we average. They are not the nicest Hilton rooms, but the are great for a family. We stayed in the North building in a 1 bdrm suite. It was nice to shut the doors and watch tv while kids slept. There is only one sink, but there is a dressing area in the bedrooom. The price is actually good. We have relatives that paid the same at a basic Best Western and they didn't have near the pool areas that we had. We had a great pool right by our room and when we wanted a change we wandered off to the River ranch, something my children enjoyed thouroghly. The food at the hole-in-the-wall for breakfast was good. The dinner a bit pricey and only average. I suggest you rent a car and try some of the other restaurants that Phoenix has to offer. If you don't have a Cracker Barrel restaurant where you are from search one out while here. They are the best. Also Aunt Chiladas is just O.K. If you come from an area with good Mexican food you will not enjoy this restaurants version. Try to eat at Macayos. Much better. All in All this is a good hotel for the price with better customer service then we have encountered in many of the high end resorts we have stayed at. I wondered where some of these other people stayed when I got there and compared reviews. I do agree that the Hilton should install safes in each room as my father (a retired Police officer) caught a 13yr old trying to steal walletts at the River Ranch.",17-May-06,23,19,5,4,1,5,1,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_9012,"Great time, excellent amenities Slight problem with the reservation. When we called in March the week before we were to arrive, they told us that our reservation change (Made in December) was not listed anywhere in their files. The reservations agent was pleasant, but said he couldnt change the reservation and we would have to check out a day earlier than planned. Since this was a reward trip, we were upset but just had him book a room for one night in Sedona (since we were going there anyway)My wife checked in on Monday afternoon with the kids. She asked for and got an upgrade to a casita. She asked when we were checking out, and they had the change in place (Magic?). She didn't say a word, just cancelled the Sedona reservation. I arrived in the evening and was very impressed with the Casita. The ground floor had a full kitchen and dinning room, half bath plus a living room with fold out bed and TV. You walk upstairs to a bedroom and full bath, with a private balcony off of the bedroom.While we did have a car, I dont understand why previous posters said there was nothing within walking distance other than Aunt Chilada's. There was a strip shopping center just across the street with a chinese carryout and some sort of sports bar. 1/2 mile away was a drug strore/liquor store and across the street from that was a supermarket.The kids enjoyed the lazy river, tubes and minature golf. We ended up buying the resort package, although the golf would have been free since we were diamond level, but I was sending and receiving large faxes and it made doing this more economical. Both restaurants were open. No complaints about the food. I read these posts and always wonder about the resorts - some people are very negative, some are very positive. I have found a balanced report is more telling. Just my $ 0.02",3-May-06,21,18,1,6,1,6,1,6,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_5364,"Enjoyable Family Stay Just returned from a last minute spring break vacation. Other than the hotel being packed to full capacity...it was a decent stay. The pool area is very family friendly, with plenty to do. A shallow/wading area for the little kids and a water slide for the bigger kids. My only complaint was the amount of people! But it was Spring Break, so what did I expect?! It was very, very crowded....with almost every lawn chair taken by 8:30 am! And the chairs are packed so close together, you can't walk through them. And they were definitely understaffed for that amount of people. The pool area would probably be more appealing at another time of year. When making your reservation....request a renovated room! ( on an upper floor)Our first room was on a bottom floor, and not renovated. It was dark  felt a little bit like a Motel 6. We requested to move and our second room was far, far better! It had been renovated and had two queen beds...it's also a larger room than one with a king bed. It's hard to believe they can charge the same price for the two different rooms. Lastly, we had an AC problem with the second room. We requested it be fixed at 8 am and at 7 pm we found it couldn't be fixed. They offered to move us, but it was 7pm with two little kids! So we stayed. But I did talk with management the next morning, and they took off one full night stay for the inconvenience. That was appreciated. Overall, I think the value of the hotel is what you pay for. I would probably go back.",15-Apr-06,15,14,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_6036,"Great Family Resort We recently stayed at the Hilton on our Spring Break. Overall, we had a fantastic stay. We were upgraded from a regular room to a Casita (because of my Hilton Honors status), and those are VERY nice. We are a family of four and it was great not to be bumping into each other constantly, with two bathrooms available. We even had a private pool tucked in between a couple of buildings, which provided a nice break from the noisier River Ranch area.The grounds are nice, and we found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The concierge personnel were great - very helpful with suggestions that always worked out well. They had cards for all of the suggested locations with addresses and directions printed out - very convenient. A fault in the hotel which was pointed out earlier is the lack of a safe in the rooms. Hotel management really needs to ask temselves where they expect the families to leave their wallets and devices when they leave their room in the morning to spend the day at the pool.The breakfast buffets that are offered at both of the onsite restaurants are very average. No made to order omlettes or waffles that are often available at other Hilton resorts. In addition, the ice cream/candy/snack shop that was onsite closed at 7 pm! Unbelievable that it wouldn't be open later during this time of year.Overall, the family had a great time and I would definetly return.",13-Apr-06,12,12,5,5,1,1,1,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1923,"Don't Stay here!!! We were robbed of $8,000 in property while staying here. At the end of our Arizona vacation, we decided to stay at this very high priced resort to give ourselves a treat. We thought, with the waterpark and all the activites, it would be a great place for our family vacation to end. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out that way. We were on the last day of our vacation when we went down to the waterpark for the day. My husband placed his shorts containing his wallet, room key and eyeglasses in a locked locker in the Men's changing room. He went to check on the locker in the afternoon to discover the lock had been cut with bolt cutters. Because we had signed for our breakfast that morning, he also had a receipt with our room number on it which allowed the thieves to go into our room and remove everything of value. Computers, cameras, i-pods and many personal items which cannot be replaced. There are no in room safes. We waited ten hours for the Phoenix police to show up and the only thing Hilton offered to do was pay for our dinner. We are still in the proccess of sorting out all the financial problems.

hotel_118,hotel_5651,"Absolutely Wonderful!!!! Our family has stayed at this hotel numerous times, the last being in July of 2005. After staying at many hotels in the Phoenix area, this has to be the best so far for us. Oh, I'm not comparing it to the Biltmore for heaven's sake! And the Scottsdale Princess was for another trip without kids. But we paid rates as high as $200 a night right to $89, depending on the time of year. Either rate, we have never had a greater time than when staying here. I have 2 boys (Ages 7 and 17) and BOTH were entertained on a regular basis. The stay in July ($89 rate) was by far the best so far! The manager, having rec'd a hysterical call from me the evening before, went over and above any hotel manager ever has. Seems that I had booked incorrectly and had us checking in one day prior to our arrival date. The manager assured me that although I didn't show up, there would be no problem for the following day. When we did arrive the following day, we were led to a townhouse type room. No, I didn't request it. No, I didn't tell them I had stayed with them before. We walked into a 2 story 3 bedroom townhouse suite! Complete with our own deck, 2 bathrooms and a smaller swimming pool in our backyard to be shared with others. What a treat! The staff was friendly, efficient and always ready to help. The maid service was exceptional and the eateries were exactly what we were looking for. No fuss, inexpensive, yet the food was delicious and always served with a smile. The night times were so nice, sitting by the fire just talking til the wee hours. We come to Phoenix at least 4 times a year, sometimes with the kids, sometimes without. Our main reason for visiting the area is because we have very close friends that relocated from NJ to Mesa, AZ. They were so impressed with our digs, they moved in for the weekend.We stayed for 5 nights, with never a dull moment. Water park was a nice starting and ending point for our touring days.

Warning- the property is large and you may have to take a shuttle around or walk fair distances depending on which room you are in. I really didn't mind walking, but I prefer a smaller property. Our room was large, two rooms, with a mini bar that had room for personal items. Our balcony primarily overlooked a parking lot, but there was a limited view of the buttes.

hotel_118,hotel_2153,"Not recommended I'm with the reviewer from Delaware (12/26/05); this place looks a lot better on the website than it does in person. I'm pretty much in overall agreement with that reviewer's comments.The rooms are dark and average (ours smelled so strongly of room freshener it was nauseating). The decor is standard Hilton hotel room; nothing imaginative or interesting. If you came with kids, you'd probably appreciate the pools and activities. We don't have kids, and aren't really into the Disney-themed plastic decoration (including a fake old western town store front theme). I thought the price of $200 per night was pretty high for what you got.The spa is, in my opinion, very misleadingly described as one of the 10 best in Arizona. I don't know what list they are working with, but I can't imagine that is the case. I booked a $165 massage. The massage itself (by Ron) was quite good. But for that kind of money, there's usually a pretty nice spa experience that goes along with it. In this case, I checked in, and the girl at the counter didn't even offer to take me to a locker room and give me a robe! I had to ask for that. The locker rooms are your regular gym-type locker room. There is a co-ed steam room and sauna. No whirlpool. After I saw a man in the steam room stretching his hamstrings in full workout gear (including gym shoes), I wouldn't have gone in the steam room if you paid me! The showers are badly in need of an overhaul -- mildewed, no water pressure. The waiting room is basically on a sofa in the beauty salon -- strong smell of nail varnish. During the massage, the table rocked throughout (it needed some sort of repair), and everytime water turned on in the hair salon you heard it loudly.One nice place to hike -- the Phoenix Mountain Park (east on Glendale past Highway 51). Great nice hikes -- although you have to drive about 10 minutes to get there.The Aunt Chiladas place was a good place to grab a bite.

The room was very clean and modern. Comfy couch and big TV in the living room. Flat screen and marble counters in the bedroom. The king bed was very nice, plenty of pillows. I was worried that because it was a weekend that the waterpark would be crowded, it wasnt. The water park is great, all the water is heated to the point where you dont feel any chill at all when stepping in. They will give you as many towels as you want. They have a bar/cafe on site and is good for a burger or dog and a beer (they also will deliver food/drinks to your seat). I easily spent all day there. Loved the lazy river, waterslide, and the big waterfall. Tip- you are allowed to bring your own pool toys (as long as theyre not huge). The restaurant had very good food and the staff was very friendly. My waitress was able to keep her cool after being yelled at by some crazy lady with 4 kids that was sitting across from me. If the restaurant is to crowded, you can always call from your room, order to go, and pick it up 10 minutes later, then take it back and enjoy your fave TV show. The small pool was also nicely heated and good for a late night swim.Overall, its a great hotel for a great price. Shop around for a discount, dont get the rack rate. I found a deal for $90/night (govt discount) during the $120/night season.

hotel_118,hotel_1074,"Over rated and dissapointing We chose this hotel after reading the good reviews -yes the grounds are pretty but we were so dissapointed with our stay, especially as I had phoned for advice and recommendations on packages and accommodations. ROOMS: We had a suite of sitting room with sofa sleeper and bedroom with 2 doubles. The first night we were in the south pointe block, very dated rooms with vanity at end of bed in main bedroom and only 4 small drawers for 5 peoples clothes for a week's stay!!!! The paint was flaking off the woodwork, the room smelled dirty even though it looked clean, and the bathroom was the most basic and I thought the smallest bathroom I have experienced in the USA. We had just spent all day driving so we just shut up and put up. Next morning we got transferred over to the north pointe block to an updated room on the ground floor which I had said was OK but the desk clerk failed to mention that there was a five foot screen blockwall enclosing our tiny patio because it adjoined the car park, the suite was tidier but the bathroom was even smaller than the first, a very short tub but slightly better shower head, thankfully the vanity had its own recess seperate to the bedroom and was pretty with granite countertop and nice fittings. You could only get out one side of the beds as I found out when I got up in the night and crashed into the wall and I am quite petite! There was more clothes storage though. Suites are better suited to a 4 people occupancy than 5, my teenage son was not amused that the maid had walked in 3 times by 8am, he was on the sofa sleeper and waiting to shower, he made sure he used the do not disturb sign after that. Registration told us that they were sorry we had been wrongly advised, we should have booked a casita.FOOD: We were advised to take out the bounceback breakfast package at an extra $20 + tax a night and that kids breakfast was free, our kids ages were on the confirmation slip so reservations knew 2 of them were over the age 12 cut off for kids meals. Bounceback breakfast only costs $8-50 at the table so it is cheaper to pay or charge it at the table on a daily basis than to purchase vouchers in advance, kids breakfast is not included but it is only $4, but our breakfast bill was an extra $15-$20 daily on top of what I had been quoted, we got another I'm sorry, you were misinformed. Also check your restaurant bill, ours was wrong 3 days out of 4 and the bounceback breakfast options varied depending on your server despite being written clearly on the menu- we opted to skip breakfast after that as we couldn't face any more meals there or any more 'I'm sorry but you were misinformed' comments - the other restaurant was closed. The restrooms in the hole in the wall are labelled 'squatters' and 'standers' which I actually found offensive.RIVER RANCH: The nightly rate only covers 4 people per suite, extra kids are $10 daily, another 'I'm sorry but you were misinformed' as I specifically asked if all resort fees were included for all 5 of us when I booked and was told - yes of course.River ranch has a lazy river (it is actually the river that is lazy, it is so slow you have to paddle yourself in order to move). There is 1 flume type slide, a toddlers pool, 2 swimming pools and a very hot spa, which I liked once they cleaned it out but I was the only one in it, others dipped toes, said ouch and walked away as it was so hot. My 5 year old was kept amused for about the same amount of time as in a regular hotel pool, my older kids were not particularly impressed and actually didn't bother swimming everyday, I had booked the hotel specifically to treat the kids to better pool facilities after they had seen the pool area on the website, they had been looking forward to staying there too.STAFF: Always friendly and courteous and very good at saying 'I am sorry you were misinformed'!! We pointed out our issues to the desk clerk when we checked out before our due departure date as the experience was ruining our vacation so much we checked into alternative accommodation, he refunded all unused bounceback vouchers and said 'Im sorry....... - you get the rest by now.",6-Nov-05,20,12,2,2,1,3,1,3,1,3.5,$184

hotel_118,hotel_6874,Beautiful location! What a beautiful hotel! We stayed only one night and arrived late (enjoyed Sedona too long) and our kids were very disappointed to find the River Ranch closing as we arrived. (It closes at 6 and opens at 9 a.m.) We had to leave in the morning so that was out too but we were able to enjoy one of the other pools. The room (2 room suite) was huge and the beds very comfy. There was a bar area with a refrig. and two TV's. It was an easy drive to a nice mall and we got to the airport in less than 20 minutes.Check-in was very easy with friendly staff.

hotel_118,hotel_1399,"Excellent Hotel - Luxurious - Living up to the Hilton Reputation I stayed here for 1 night only on business. We stayed in an array of hotels but this was by far the best. Check In was quick and easy. We arrived in our rooms and we upgraded to a suite. WOW!! Two huge very comfy beds, wide screen tv, lovely bathroom. Kitchen area with breakfast bar and sitting room area. All rooms do have balconies but they all dont have excellent views - if you are lucky you get pool view but others over look car parks etc - not so good!! We werent here for long but managed to sample to water slides and pools - they were lovely in nice settings. Also there are numerous other pools nearer to the rooms which have jacuzzis. These are open 24 hours which is good but there are a lot of kids here obviously so it gets a bit crowded. Had a meal at the hole in the wall restaurant which was nice - has a cow boy theme and sells grill type food. There was entertainmerment here. If you can sit outside here - I would as inside is quite poorly lit and we found it made you very drowsy indeed. Also it took quite a while for the food to be served but there was a large group of us so I suppose it could be expected. The service I found was very friendly nothing was too much trouble. There is also a shop onsite which sells souvenirs and drinks etc which is quite handy. Would have liked to spend a bit more time here as felt didnt really see they whole complex as it is fairly large. Only complaint I would have is we couldnt find any safes in the rooms. Not sure if they had any or they were too well hidden haha. All in all a great hotel - Definately 4*!!!!",30-Oct-05,7,6,5,6,1,6,1,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_3332,Great family vacation Stayed at the Hilton Squaw Peak for a week with my family and my neighbour and his family. I am HH Diamond and booked both rooms and we were both upgraded to a Casita and given two breakfast vouchers per day. The kids (ages 5-9) loved the River ranch and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We went during early October and aside from the weekend there were very few people at the pools so it was fairly quiet. I even saw a few people floating down the lazy river reading a book 鈥?you probably couldn鈥檛 do that during the high season. We also spent an afternoon at the Tapito Cliffs Hilton which was very nice but more suited to adults than families - although they did have a very good waterslide.All in all it was an excellent vacation and I will return next year.,17-Oct-05,10,9,5,5,1,5,1,5,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_9898,"Beautiful landscape....dangerous couch My fianc茅e and I arrived at the Squaw Peak Hilton on 9/24 for 2 nights. As a Hilton gold card member we were upgraded to a very nice and spacious room. It had 1 and a half bathrooms, 2 TVs, kitchen area, large couch and a boardroom table that could seat 8! The only minus was the sink outside the bathroom 鈥?I so hate that.However, after getting settled in, I happened to notice a small shard of glass on the living room couch. This alarmed me as it is obviously dangerous if someone sat down or a child picked it up. Otherwise the room was very clean. On Monday 9/26, we awoke to a loud racket at 6:30 a.m. only to find a very large crane right outside our bedroom balcony doing some sort of building work. Needless to say, it ruined any chance of a restful morning. It finished at 9:00 a.m. My question is why did the management need to disturb guests at such an early hour? Had the noise began at 9:00 a.m., fair enough, but 6:30? Why so early and directly outside occupied rooms? The grounds were beautiful and the pool area was clean and well kept. The Hole in the Wall restaurant was good, but it was the only option for a restaurant as the other was being renovated. It was also the only bar available apart from the pool bar that had limited hours. I've never been in a Hilton hotel without an inside bar or at least a coffee shop. This had neither.",13-Oct-05,15,15,4,5,1,3,1,4,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_7345,"nice family vacation spot! Just got back from a five day stay at Hilton Squaw Peak and found it to be a nice hotel. The suite was a nice change from having just a room, and the extra television set was great for my daughter. The beds were comfortable and had nice linens and a down comforter (although not what you need in Phoenix in August!!) I felt the room was dark and needed some updating. I don't care for sinks outside the bathroom...and you guessed it...here the sink is outside the bathroom! Initially, when we checked in we were given a first floor South suite location. This room was not to our liking, since it was in a dark part of the building that seemed out of the way! We immediately went back to the desk and they offered us a room on the fourth floor. The room was better...however, the elevator to get to the room had no a.c. and the fan did not work!! We realized this was a problem after we had already unpacked! So for five days, my daughter and I ran up and down the stairs to get to the room while my husband decided to tuff it out in the elevator! (Note: I told my husband we should complain about the elevator, but he insisted that this is probably something they are well aware of! To be continued...at end of review) They appeared to be doing lots of updating around the premises (but not to the elevator!) The pool area for the South building was closed due to renovations, however, during our stay, we never witnessed any renovation work going on there! The water park area was nice, and since we were there midweek, there were no crowds to contend with! The lazy river was soooo lazy that sometimes, we actually paddled our way through it! High marks for the cleanliness of the pool area (especially the bathrooms..kept nice and clean!).Ate several times at Hole in the Wall and was very pleased with the food. Had a great waitress the first time we ate there so we were sure to return. This waitress brought to our attention that kids eat free which we were unaware of! Nice bonus! However, upon our return visits, we were charged for our daughter's meal and had to remind our servers of this! The service got worse and worse with each return trip and we never saw that first waitress again! We ate at Aunt Chilada's and found it to be an excellent dining experience! (great chips!!)Also had breakfast at 5th and Diner and enjoyed it! Every time we wanted to eat away from the hotel, we needed to drive at least 10-15 mins. to do so. I would have liked a hotel that had places to eat and shop that were a bit closer or walkable. Before I selected this hotel for our stay, I read many reviews and selectedthe Hilton based on the information I gathered. The kid-friendly factor was key to my selection of this hotel and our daughter did enjoy the water park facilities. I would have liked spiffier accommodations for my husband and I to feel a bit pampered, but I guess at the rate we got, it was what we paid for! Back to the elevator story....(I didn't forget!!) when we were checking out, I decided to mention to the desk person that the elevator in our part of the building had no a.c. or fan and that it caused lots of inconvenience for us. She said they were unaware of this and that no one else mentioned it! My husband didn't believe her but she did seem sincere...who knows?",2-Sep-05,10,9,5,4,1,5,1,4,1,3.5,$184

hotel_118,hotel_4358,"Great weekend getaway My husband and I spent the weekend enjoying this excellent resort at a great summer rate. We had a regular suite that was very nice and comfortable. The bed was a little hard but not too bad. The room faced the patio instead of the pool so it was quiet even at night when everyone came back from the water park. The River Park was lots of fun even if you don't have kids. The slide and river float were enjoyable and it's a great place for people watching. When it got too crowded for us, we went to one of the smaller pools. Tip: the drinks are $1 cheaper at the bar next to the pool behind the main lobby than they are in the Park. If you just want to sit in the water and have a few drinks, then spend the afternoon there while all of the other guests are in the big pool.The service was outstanding from the room service guy to the pool boys. Everyone was friendly and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. The location was good because it was only a few blocks to Highway 51 (Squaw Peak Express) and you can get to all of the other highways quickly from it. The baseball park was only 15 minutes away and the Improv nightclub in Tempe was only 20 minutes (we did not travel during rush hour). I shopped around heavily for rates and as usual, the Hilton web site had the best rates and packages. We will definitely return next summer.",22-Aug-05,9,9,5,5,1,5,1,6,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_5595,"Family fun  Stayed from 3 nights from 28 June. Booked directly through their website  selected a Bounceback Vacation at $99 nightly which included breakfast for two adults. We were advised during a quick, pleasant and straightforward check-in that kids eat free on this deal - this was not advertised so came as a very welcome surprise. Optional $9 daily resort passes were explained to us but we were not pressured to buy them. [In fact these seemed to represent very good value when shared by a family who would use the additional facilities]. On booking I had requested only that our room be not too far from pools. We were allocated a remodelled room top floor North Tower: Yes our balcony overlooked the inescapable car park but directly beyond that only mountains with fantastic view of sunrise [which with jet lag we were able to fully appreciate each morning!].... and excepting the Casitas it was as close as could be to the River Ranch pools.The Hotel and Grounds were attractively landscaped and commendably vigilently maintained. Our suite itself was immaculate - spacious, comfortably but not overfussily furbished, well laid out  generous storage. The bathroom  dressing areas  fittings superb. Wonderfully comfortable Beds and especially the plumpest ever pillows get a special thumbs up.The River Ranch was great for families with younger kids - nothing too hardcore for thrill seeking teenagers mind. One decent Water Slide, [very] lazy river, waterfalls, sporty pools set up for volleyball, basketball etc, kids pools - you name it. It was at all times generously staffed and very well maintained. I was particularly impressed with Poolside RestRooms - which can't be easy to keep spotless all day long but they managed. Refrigerated drinking water was freely available throughout the resort. Pool water was probably more heavily chlorinated than your skin appreciates but certainly not more so than other hotel pools. River Ranch opening hours were from 8.30am to 8.30pm but the good-sized and [while we were there] tranquil courtyard pools and hot tubs are open from 5.30am until... 11pm, I think - so if you are noise sensitive you might not appreciate being allocated a ground floor room in this area. The Kids Koyote Club was way out of our budget to send the Kids just for the fun of it if you were remaining on-site [about $60 per child per day session I think?] but no dobt a valuable service for those here on a conference or needing some time out. They also offered a great $5 midday movie  popcorn to entice the kids out of the midday sun. We ate three times at the Hole in the Wall Restaurant: Two breaksfasts and one dinner. Service and food both consistently exceptional - very child friendly indeed. The lovely location of the terrace overlooking the River Ranch is the icing on the cake. Lest this review read like I am a share-holder [although after this experience I might just consider?] let me say that our only negative experience was a breakfast at the Lantana Grill [this place seems more oriented to Squaw Peaks other key market - Conference - than family market]. On our visit here customers seemed to be outnumbered by staff about 3 to one yet it took 20 minutes to have our order taken and another 30 for our breakfasts to arrive - when it did the orders were wrong but we were running so late by then I confess we let it go. Lantana Grill menu prices seemed comparable to Hole in the Wall but neither portions nor quality of food was close. The staff stood around in large groups talking and ignoring us. When I visited the restroom it clearly hadn't been checked for hours as the bins were flowing over and the wet floor strewn with wet towels .. and crawling along the foor I saw the only cockroach I spotted in the entire resort grounds.We also dined at the adjacent Aunt Chiladas Mexican which has been enthusiastically reviewed on this site. I confess I was very disappointed with the food which appeared at our table in the blink of an eye after our orders were taken ........ and was bland and overcooked. However I do have to admit their complimentary chips  dips are as good as any I ever tasted and the ambience was great!  We were fortunate to visit midweek when the resort was lively enough to be buzzing but not in any way crowded. As we were leaving [start of July 4 holiday weekend] the hotel was clearly heavily booked and getting hectic - possibly I may not have enjoyed that weekend quite so much. Nor would it be my first choice for a romantic weekend away from the kids. I have no doubt that there are more exclusive resorts in Phoenix - with plusher pool towels, but in this price range? - at $99 daily with a delicious  generous breakfast for four, lovely environment to relax in, all day entertainment poolside without having to fork out an extra penny ... and the best nights sleep away from home - why it quite distracted me from lamenting the heat!If I were management at the Hilton Squaw Peak I would be extremely proud of my staff who succeed in keeping the place so pristine and providing a genuine welcome for families.",19-Jul-05,15,13,6,5,1,6,1,5,1,3.5,$184

The Buffet brunch at the Camelback Inn was great - take a book, sit outside, spend the morning and eat as much as you like - they were very welcoming - The Biltmore is not to be missed - a great place to visit and a good place for breakfast - Or if you have the time and money the Wright Place is supposed to be great.

hotel_118,hotel_7482,"The Tale of an Idiot Desk Clerk While the facilities are acceptable, and in some cases great (water park), the desk staff could be judged somewhere between incompetent and hostile. We arranged with a girl at the desk to provide a room key to our son who was arriving later in the day, and for whom we'd reserved an extra room. She smilingly assured us all would be taken care of. When we returned late in the afternoon, we discovered by phone that our son's room still was not ready and that he hadn't checked in. We suspected something amiss and so waited in line to talk with the smiling girl who'd promised everything would go so smoothly. She avoided talking to us - before our turn arrived, she signalled to a male desk clerk to take care of us, though at that point we'd given no signs of being upset. We simply wanted to know if our son had arrived. She obviously knew things had not proceeded according to plan and was afraid to face us.We were directed - rather escorted - to speak to a male desk clerk who was already bristling, though nothing had yet been said. My wife asked if our son had arrived and was told yes. Was he given a key to our room? No, because he hadn't a picture ID! But he has his passport - he just flew in from Montreal, my wife said. Lower your voice when you're speaking to me! the man replied, though I didn't note anything extraordinary in her tone. His escapist reply might have been comical, were it not so rude. But we arranged for him to be given a key... my wife continued, nearly whispering, and glancing to her side at the (formerly) smiling girl who was now leaving the reception area to escape any possibility of becoming involved.I was wondering what the man would say in regard to the passport - obviously our son could not fly in without an adequate picture ID. Don't point your hand at me! the man instead replied, though all my wife was doing was resting her right hand (she was holding our car keys) on the countertop, while her left hand was still holding her purse.That desk clerk could be termed a cretin, a loose cannon, an untrained or idiot Faulty Towers like clerk - whatever - but I have little inclination to ever return to that hotel just because of him and the smiling girl who apparently feared involvement because her colleague had probably intervened and refused my son a key.The Pointe's grounds at Squaw Peak are extensive. We searched for our son for nearly an hour before we found him - our paths between the Hole in the Wall and Dantano restaurants and the pool, convention center and room nearly crossed several times, till finally we called for the Nth time on one of the hotel phones and received word he'd checked in What a joke! It was after 4:00 p.m. We also received a message on our room phone to that effect.The following day, the idiot clerk graced with us a perky good morning, etc., while the smiling girl avoided looking. I felt a strong inclination to answer his good morning with Don't raise your voice at me!, but why escalate things with a moron.They've got a great water park - and maybe it justifies dealing with idiots. I'll leave that matter to other guests to balance out. Some items in our room were non-functional (e.g. high-speed Internet), but I could easily have overlooked them - in fact, one can overlook a lot of small deficiencies, if only the staff is civil. All it took was a friendly attitude, an apology and display of some concern - none of which that idiot displayed.",22-May-05,20,12,5,5,1,5,1,2,1,3.5,$184

The Cicada was very out-dated and in needof a few upgrades, particularly the carpet. They spared no expense onthe beds. The beds were very comfortable with down blankets andpillows. My 9 year old daughter said that this wouldn't be a 3 starhotel if it wasn't for the beds.The Hole in the Wall restaurant was good food and average service. Thefirst couple of meals were fine but one morning for breakfast we waitedover 40 mins. And never saw our food or water again. We had to trackhim down in order to get our bill because my wife had meetings toattend. They did box up my food to take with me at no charge. Theyinformed us that they were very busy that morning and apologized. The service by the pool was horrendous. There were very few people totake care of a very large area. We had an average wait time of about ahalf hour for a drink. At one point a server had noticed that a halfdozen flags on our lounge chairs were up and he told us that our serverwas busy and he walked off and sat down next to a girl sun bathing andcontinued to talk to her while we waited. When our guy did show upthere were so many orders to take it was another 20 mins before wereceived our drinks. Oh, and he forgot my two daughters' drinks...After that I decided to just go to the bar (Slim Picken's) myself. Onlyproblem here is there isn't enough staff to service all of the serversand people at the bar and people that can't get served. While my wifewas in meetings we were at the pool and the service continued like thisfor three days until my very hungry wife (day 3) who was never servedbreakfast met us by the pool for lunch. We figured a hotdog lunch anddrinks but we only saw one server and because of this the line at thebar was about a 30 min wait. My wife had called to let the manager knowthat the pool was way under staffed and that if we can't get served andcan't bring anything into the pool area, how were we going to eat? The manager sent us the director of the Slim Picken's and Hole in theWall. This guy was very nice and apologetic and offered to get us aseat at the Hole in the Wall but we informed him that there was a chancewe would get served because or our earlier experience at breakfast.This man not only personally served us lunch by the pool but hecompletely fixed the pool services problem. Six people showed up andall the lines went away. Servers were walking around asking if youwanted anything because everyone was taken care of. He also to oursurprise took care of our dinner bill that night.We also ate at the Aunt Chiladas restaurant.

The casita was large enough for all of us. Nice size living area, small kitchen, nothing other than refridgerator and microwave. The bedrooms were fine. The bathrooms needed better lighting. I guess I just feel when you are paying $700.00 a night it should be nice, not just alright. It was very dated looking, dark and worn-out looking. The large pool and lazy river were nice, but very crowded. You had to stake out chairs very early in the morning. We normally just went over to go on the lazy river then came back to the small pool by our casita to swim and lay out.

There were 5 of us (kids 7, 5, and 2), in a 2BR/2.5BA Casita.Pros: Tons of room in the Casita, the lower level living area is huge, with a kitchenette too, covered parking, and a large deck upstairs. We had a 2 BR for 5 of us but a 1BR would have worked fine because of the two Queen beds and a pull-out sofa and 1/2 bath downstairs. Nice big pool area. The kids loved the lazy river and water slide. Excellent fitness center with plenty of free weights, machines, and cardio. Great kids concierge area with plenty of free games to check out.Cons: We had breakfast everyday in the restaurants, mainly because I had vouchers. Terrible service. Yes it was crowded but they are still severely understaffed. Also breakfast was expensive ($12-$15 for a so-so buffett that didn't include coffee or juice). The last 2 days we just went with the buffett anyway because the wait to order and get your food was so long. The rooms, though large and fine for us, are definitely dated. The hotel needs a remodel fairly soon. Though it was obviously a busy time of year, the pool area got very crowded with few chairs to be after 10:00.Overall, a nice place to stay in a pretty good location, especially if you love to swim and have the little ones with you.",1-Apr-05,2,2,5,5,1,5,1,3,1,3.5,$184

The main pool was a bit crowded, then again, it was spring break. Spent a few mornings at the sister resort, Tapatito Cliffs which was a nice change of pace. Staff was warm and friendly at both. Took a guided hike, enjoyed the spa, and many other attractions AZ has to offer such as the Botanical Gardens, Rawhide, Spring Training Baseball games, and more.

hotel_118,hotel_4322,"A great family holiday! We went to the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak last March. We arrived in the pouring rain. It was flooded everywhere but we didn't mind cause there was no snow!Our check in went very smoothly. We were offered bellhop service but chose to find our room ourselves. We had requested that we be away from the 24 hour pools (less noisy) and on the top floor if possible. Both our requests were met. Our room was clean, spacious and even had a microwave! Our view was of the parking lot but was partially screened by a huge palm tree growing right outside our window. We were at the very end of the row of rooms closest to the side entrance into the complex.-good because there weren't people walking back and forth in front of our room... bad because the view wasn't great from either window! (Also the garbage truck came in the side entrance and you might be disturbed by the noise)We bought the BounceBack package which gave us food vouchers for breakfast every day at either of the two restaraunts on the property. A very good deal (We loved both of them) .Lantana had great Mexican shredded beef! Hole in the Wall was more fun being right outside by the pool. Suggestion to those who have read this far... get there early 'cause it fills up fast. We never ate the buffet because there were so many other tasty things on the menu. As for lunch, we broke the bank and ordered poolside, heh you only live once! The quesadillas were quite good!Dinner we went off property. Aunt Chilladas across the street was very good. Large servings of Mexican and reasonably priced. It is a hike from the far side of the property, so have the bellman drive you over in his cart! We went way out of town to a place that had sawdust on the floor and neckties hanging from the ceiling (this place was in one of our guide books, maybe Frommers) and it was a waste of money. Sorry I can't recall the name! The pool... lots of fun, even for my 12 and 13 year old boys. They enjoyed floating very slowly (it was very crowded and bottle necks occurred lots) down the lazy river and they also had fun in the larger pool as well. Another hint for those who are still reading... the lounge chairs can be very hard to get especially under an umbrella. Make sure to get up early and get down to the pool so that you can get a chair. I mean stand in line at the pool entrance before it opens , lots of others will be there already, I promise you!!! (Warning -Don't try to save a chair by sneaking in early thru the tennis courts - there are empoyees who watch for this tactic and will take your stuff away or send you back out on your way!!! First hand experience!)We had fun playing tennis; choosing early morning or evening court times to avoid the heat. Be sure to book reservations because they too fill up!Have fun. You won't be disappointed in this family resort destination!This is a very good property for families, Try it , you'll see!",19-Mar-05,7,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_4221,"What a great place! My family just returned from a 4 day getaway. We really enjoyed the WARM pools, the beautiful grounds, and the friendly staff. The water park is fun but the lobby pool is so close and warm. It rained quite a bit but we went in the pool anyway and it was great! The spa was a bit pricey so we passed on that, same with the on grounds resturants. We will be back next year!",22-Feb-05,3,3,4,5,1,5,1,4,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1531,"Ok, but nothing great. We selected this hotel because of the water park for the children. They did enjoy it, but it wasn't as exciting as the literature led us to believe. The lazy river was very lazy--really, really slow. The kids went to the pool underwater bar after closing and thought it was a blast (no drinking of course). The room was adequate, but not terribly bright. The first room we were assigned, on the first floor, was very dark. I would not recommend those rooms. The bedroom was decent size. Beware though--both beds were very uncomfortable for us. The living area was ok. Our guidebook described the grounds as lushly planted. That was a bit generous. The grounds are nice, but again, nothing spectacular. Staff was very nice. The Latanya grille was pretty good and had fabulous corn bread. Restaurant within walking distance, Aunt Chiladas, had a very nice courtyard and good food. Overall, the hotel was a decent value (we paid $110 a night) but not a place to get excited about.",27-Dec-04,5,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_5009,"Casitas are comfortable Stayed in a bi-level casita for a week. It was very comfortable, the bed was good. The layout was good, and it was quiet and felt pretty private. The property is very large. They have a good workout room which does get crowded. The location is Phoenix is convenient. My complaint about the room was the decor, it wasn't good. Also, there was very little lighting in the bathroom, I had to keep the window open and have the heat lamp on to see in the shower. I was happy to have a full size fridge and private carport. I'd be willing to stay here again, but there are a lot of fancier options in Phoenix/Scottsdale for the same price or a little more - I'd rather pay a little more for something awesome. I was travelling for business, and didn't get a chance to try out the lazy river and the pools but they looked nice. This would be a good place to bring the family. Room service was good too.",20-Nov-04,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_10436,"Ideal for families We stayed at the Pointe Hilton in August and had a great time. The staff are polite and helpful, the suites are a good size for a family of four, the food and drink are not overpriced and in both restaurants kids ate free from the kids menu. We asked for a fridge in the room so we could stock up on Beer and Soda, this was not available but they didn't mind us taking everything out of the Mini Bar and using that. No charge was made for this as it is in some hotels. We stayed in the North Pointe which was about 3 mins walk from the main reception. I can't understand the complaints about some areas being miles from the pool etc, this is advertised as a large resort what do you expect? There are plenty of golf buggys scootin about and the staff are only too happy to give you a ride. The waterpark was not quite as impressive as I had imagined and does get very crowded at weekends but the kids enjoyed it and if it gets too much you can always use one of the smaller pools. We had one right outside our door and used this one at weekends. Each building has a Washing machine and dryer on one of the floors which was very useful. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again . I would certainly recommend the Squaw Peak to anyone who wants a good base to explore the surrounding area and just sit back with a glass of wine while the kids spend all day in the pool.",15-Oct-04,7,7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184

hotel_118,hotel_5818,"good time at the Pointe We just got back from 5 nights at the resort. We went along with two other families and had a great time. We arrived at 2 PM and were allowed to check-in early. We requested a room close to the water park and a mini-fridge and got both! We were also able to get room right next to each other. We were told there was 97% occupancy rate for the holiday weekend but it didn't seem too crowded. The rooms were fine, a nice size but small bathroom. The furnishings were a little old but suffficed for our family of five. It was quiet and clean. We ate lunch daily in the restaurant by the pool because we had the $30 daily food credit deal and it was convenient. The food was good but the service was very slow. The waterpark itself is just ok. We stayed at the Pointe South Mountain last summer and it's water park is much better with more to offer. Here there is just one small waterslide and a very lazy river. The kiddie pool was great for our four year old as well as the larger pool with zero entry. The Pointe South Mountain offers free cabanas and here there are just umbrellas if you are lucky enough to snag one (you have to get to the pool at 8 am to claim your spot). There are no shaded areas.  We met several families who return every year but for us, we would rather spend a little more money and go back to the Pointe South Mountain. There is more to offer for older children (we also have an 11 and 13 yr old) and the resort seems a little newer.",7-Jul-04,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_1039,"Pointe Hilton Squaw Peake We stayed for three nights beginning June 21, 2004. We had gotten a great internet rate including breakfast for the adults. This is normally an off-peak time so we were unprepared for the crowds at the water park. It was nearly impossible to find a lounge chair after 9 am. That being said, the children loved the waterpark and pools. On Saturday nights, the resort shows a G/PG rated movie poolisde so the kids can watch in or out of the water. There were other planned activities during the weekend. The rooms were large and clean. The food was well priced for a resort. I would definitely stay here again with children.",29-Jun-04,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_3213,Be Prepared for Crowds! Must have stayed here on a busy weekend because we planned to stay for three nights and couldnt wait to get out after one night! I was told a low rate is offered to local people during the off season and they all must have taken advantage of it! The waterpark was nice but way too crowded to enjoy...even my 8 year old didnt want to deal with it. The room being a suite was great for the family and decor was pleasant. I think being located overlooking the 24 hour pool didnt help either (why does a pool really need to be open for that long?). Breakfast was included in our good rate and we enjoyed having a couple choice of restaurants. Had better rates at the Camelback Inn and the Doubletree Paradise Valley which I would chose over this hotel...... Unless you have a few kids who dont mind a crowded water park.,24-Jun-04,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_2497,"Highly recommended This is such a great hotel for families (though we first stayed here 9 years earlier - and enjoyed it just as much without a child!). We stayed here for three nights in May 04, before touring Arizona. An early flight meant that we arrived at 11 am - though this wasn't a problem and we were immediately checked into our room. The suite with seperate living room was perfect for us and our 5 year old son. The view wasn't great, but with the lovely pool with swim-up bar  children's pool just downstairs, it really didn't matter.The waterpark is great fun and surprisingly relaxing. Our son was content to float around the lazy river for ages, whilst we relaxed doing the same. The waterpark was busy on the Sun, but very quiet on the Mon  Tue.The Lantana restaurant was the best place for food, though the Hole in the Wall was good for breakfast.Our only real complaint was that the kid's club was closed, as they apparently require 3 or more kids to open it. I guess this was because it was the start of the low season - it was still a disappointment as the hotel blurb led us to believe that it was open year round.If you are travelling from the UK, this hotel can be booked very cheaply through Trailfinders (we paid 拢75 inc tax) - better than any other web deals.",11-Jun-04,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184

The rooms are older and very average, but the water features are GREAT. Kids and adults alike will love it! There is a Lazy River where you can float around a water course on an innertube (provided by the resort). There's waterfalls; several pools; water volleyball; fantastic drink specials; and a western themed restaurant. For dining out, please go elsewhere! Phoenix boasts many great restaurants, but none of them are at this resort!

hotel_118,hotel_9992,"A disappointment I stayed at the Squaw Peak last week for a business meeting. I had been eagerly anticipating my stay, since I've been to it's sister property--the Tapitio Cliffs and reallly enjoyed it. Boy was I disappointed!This property is old, and it looks it. The rooms are fine---clean and updated--but the property itself is quite run down. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful but I never got passed the fact that the hotel itself is nowhere near a peak---it's on a busy road across the street from a bank--and that the grounds, elevators, hallways were a mess.The food at the main restaurant was adequate at best. Same for room service. And if you're thinking of planning a meeting here, be warned---the catering is really sub-par.If I had to stay here again for business, I'd do it. But never for pleasure.

I went to the fromt desk in the morning and asked for a more comfortable room-we were moved to the 3rd floor-the beds were much better! Saturday night is a nosiy night there so if you go-be prepared for noise!Also-we bought the resort package for an extra $9 per day-we got to use the gym(nice!) and paly mini golf-cute course winding around the lazy river........I would go back-the rooms are affordable and the kids LOVED it!,4-Oct-03,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3.5,$184 
hotel_118,hotel_2005,"Two thumbs up My wife and I just returned from our second visit to the Pointe Squaw Peak this summer. Our first was virtually flawless - marred only by a drunk banging on the door of an adjacent casita. The GM took this incident to heart and comped one night of our most recent stay. This stay was even better. Some of the front desk staff could use some instruction on people-handling, but this did not detract in any way from the over all experience. We are Hilton Diamond VIP members, and service at this Pointe (as well as the Tapatio Cliffs) is as attentive if not more so than the Waldorf Astoria or the Palmer House or the Conrad London.
